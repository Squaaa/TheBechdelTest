# TheBechdelTest
Hello and welcome to our Github Repository, website found at: https://squaaa.github.io/TheBechdelTest/. Screen cast: https://youtu.be/rT0KUyjJbmM.

Our goal for this project was to create a interactive story describing the state of female representation (or lackthereof)
in cinema. Using the Bechdel Test as a metric, we detailed the history of successes and failures in the film industry
particularly highlighting 2016's top box office hits as points of observation to show how Hollywood has a bunch of work to
do on the representation front. But enough overview, let's give the website a breakdown.

(Most of the sections of the website had a main person working on it, but received contributions from others on the team.
The contributions are shown in the git logs so I'll only get into the main person working on each part.)

The landing page, website progression/navigation, and introduction were mainly developed by Jess.

From there the website moves on to the first user interaction where we prompt them to select movies that passed the Bechdel Test; this section was mainly developed by Lucy.
Selecting the bar reveals more information about the movies and a relevant Bechdel test video, the initial bar chart and
information was mainly developed by J.

The section below includes our innovative view the bubble chart. Here you can select a movie and the movie characters
are placed in bubbles colored by gender identity and sized based the number of words spoken. It's also filterable based
on gender and role (lead vs. supporting). The ratio of characters and dialogue between men and women is also displayed.
Additionally, the crew breakdown by gender is displayed in the bottom left. These items were mainly developed by Cassandra.

The following section prompts the user to guess the first year where at least 50% of movies passed the Bechdel
Test. Your answer will be displayed on an area chart along with the correct answer. The area chart is filterable displaying
things like revenue, budget, percentage of success, etc. You can also highlight an specific portion of the area chart to
refilter the genre bar chart below. Mousing over different areas of the section provides new information. This section
was mainly developed by Lucy.

The conclusion including so what, about us, and credits was a team effort.

We used a few libraries such as annotation, tip, popper, and queue, but nothing outside of items used in lab. This
website is a product of our blood, sweat, tears and multiple nights where someone would send a msg at 2am only to find out
that everyone else is also awake at 2am working on the project.

Thanks so much for visiting our website, if you want a more exciting readme file, head on over to README2.md
