Life is a spinning wheel,
it has been said.
With each spoke, a tale to be told.
So keep silence along the banks,
and I will tell you one of these tales.
A story as enchanting as
the jungle itself.
It is about pride and
power and treasure...
and about fangs and claws and talons.
But mostly, it is about love.
My new command was
at the edge of the world,
surrounded by a million miles of jungle.
With me was my daughter, Katherine,
whom everyone called Kitty.
Leading us was an Indian guide...
whose son was called Mowgli.
From the moment they were born,
Mowgli and Kitty had a common bond,
for both of their mothers had left
this world while bringing them into it.
Also with us was my good friend,
Dr. Julius Plumford,
who was to be our surgeon.
Oh, look at that.
Damned elephant!
Pull yourself together!
Shere Khan.
All right.That's enough.
That's enough!
I say, could somebody
possibly grab this elephant?
Sorry to bother you.
And as surely as a tiger
named Shere Khan...
was to be the jungle's royal keeper,
Mowgli was destined to become its lord.
Well done, Mowgli.
Buldeo, what on earth's going on?
Shere Khan!
He's returning!
- Shere? A tiger?
- Shere Khan, king of tigers!
He's angry because these men with
their guns have gone into his jungle...
and killed more than they can eat.
What is a tiger caring,
a few animals here or there?
Would you allow someone to break
into your house and steal your food?
These three broke the jungle law.
Shere Khan knows it.
We best beware.
All right.
What is this?
Baloo.
- And in English?
- Bear.
Good.
I'll bet you can't tell me what this is.
Bagheera.
Panther?
Very good.
And who do you think this is?
- That's me!
- You? Shere Khan?
The holy man say I'm half a tiger.
You are half a tiger?
He say when I see Shere Khan
and show no fear,
then I be whole tiger.
Where did you see
this holy man, Mowgli?
In my dreams.
No.
Help!
Tiger.! Tiger attack.!
Geoffrey, what in God's
name is going on?
A tiger!
I think it got Claibourne!
Claibourne? Right.
I'll see to him.
Stay here, Mowgli!
Bapu?
Damn!
Get him out of the way!
Bapu.! Bapu.!
Shere Khan!
Ha! Shoot him, Buldeo! Ha!
God! Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Got you!
Damn it! Damn it!
Get out of my way!
Out of my way!
Oh, my God! The boy!
Where's Mowgli, Father?
He's gone, Kitty.
The boy is gone.
Bapu?
Bapu?
Bapu?
Bapu?
Bapu? Bapu?
Bagheera.
Shere Khan.
Baloo?
Keep up, ladies, keep up!
Now, who can tell me what kind
of monkey that is over there?
Nevermind, nevermind. Um...
What about those over there?
Who can name those? You see them?
Anybody?
Kitty!
Yes, Doctor?
Perhaps you can name the primates
that we are a bout to paint.
That one there is a macaque,
those two are rhesus,
and the bunch up there are langurs.
Well, at least I've taught
somebody something.
Oh, my goodness! There's a
spider-monkey with a mustache!
- Oh, where?
- Where?
He's got a white hat on
and a linen suit.
Now, this bridge...
separates mankind from
the animal kingdom.
To cross over there is
to take your life in your hands.
You see this sign?
It says, " Danger:
" To cross this bridge
is to enter the black jungle,
the jungle of death."
- Actually, Doctor,
- Hmm?
All the sign says is,
" Beware, this bridge is old."
It's a very literal translation, Kitty.
Come on, ladies.
We'll do our painting down there.
- I dare you to cross it.
- I would never.
- Neither would I.
- Well, I certainly wouldn't.
I would.
Why am I not surprised?
Hello.
Hello?
Hello?
He'll kill you.
Whoa! Katherine!
- Hello, William.
- What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to cross the bridge.
You know it's dangerous.
- I know, I know.
- You're a very naughty girl.
- Not in public, Willie.
- Public?
What public?
I seem to remember our last kiss
being quite public.
Heat of the moment, my good man.
Heat of the moment.
- Now we best get back across the bridge.
- I should warn you.
I'm feeling quite the hunter today.
And am I to be your prey?
What the...
Why, you little savage!
And what have we here?
An animal. An animal that needs to be
taught a lesson in manners, I think.
Come on.!
Put them up.! Put them up.!
- Be careful, William.
- Don't worry, Katherine. I'll protect you.
Actually, William, I think
that's what he's trying to do.
Come on. Putt hem up.
Thrash him! Thrash him good,
Billy boy! Come on!
You're a dead one, you are.
- You all right, Billy?
- Get him!
Now you'll get yours, sunshine.
- Well, get him!
- Yes! Raah!
- Stay exactly where you are!
- Put the gun away.!
- William, tell him.
- Keep out of this, Katherine.
- I'm warning you.
- Shoot him!
Shoot him.!
- Just... Just stay back.
- I said shoot him, Wilkins! That's an order!
Leave him, Wilkins. He's harmless.
- Come on, man.! Shoot him.!
- I'm warning you!
Left, right, left, right, left.!
Left, right, left, right, left, right.
- You heard from them lately?
- Not a one.
Atten-tion!
Officer present.!
Stand at ease.!
Bloody elephants.
Intruder! Intruder!
Don't just stand there!
After him! Sound the alarm!
Intruder at the main gate.!
What are you doing here?
Please leave.
If I scream, they'll hear me.
Please, you must go.
All right, I'll take it,
but only if you promise to leave.
There. Go now.
What is it with you
and flowers and kissing?
Billy! Billy!
It's the savage we fought
in the jungle. He's here.
What?
Who are you?
Do you speak English?
No. Hindi?
Do you speak anything?
Don't touch that.
Oh. I told you.
Here.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Where did you get this?
Where did you get this?
This used to be mine.
Mowgli. Mowgli.
I'm Kitty.
Kitty Brydon.
Oh, God! You've got to leave quickly.
- Go.! They'll kill you. Go.!
- Get him!
- No! William.
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
- Did he touch you?
- No, no, no. He's harmless.
- Wilkins!
- Gone! Just listen to me.
All right, stay here
and lock the door.
No, please. You don't understand.
William!
There he is! On the wall!
Patrol, on the double!
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Out of the way.
Get out of here, you swine!
There he is!
Out of the way!
We've got him!
Come down here! Get down here!
Down, down, down!
Come down here!
Go ahead.You've got him!
Are you all right?
Hunaman.
Thank you, Buldeo.
That's Queen's evidence now.
Yes, Captain, sahib.
Stolen from some rich maharaja,
no doubt.
No doubt.
Captain, sahib.!
That dagger... is having
very important family.
Come on.
Ah, my favorite officers.
Evening, gents.
- Harley.
- Evening, Harley.
And what have we got here, then?
Caught this one attempting
to kill the Colonel's daughter.
Well, we can't be having
any of that now, can we?
And... we found this on him.
May have a brother and sister.
Well, we can't be separatin'
no family now, can we?
- No, we most certainly cannot.
- Right.
Come on, my little brown brother.
Time to wake up. Tell Uncle Harley
where you got the dagger.
Come on!
You little...
Hold him! Hold him!
Push him in! Push him in!
Sergeant Harley.!
Come to order, if you please.!
What is going on here?
This is the, uh, intruder we caught.
I'm aware of that, but does detaining a prisoner
mean you have to beat him half to death?
He kicked me in the sweets, sir.
- Your sweets, eh, Harley?
- Sir!
- What's his name?
- Don't know, sir.
What is your name?
If I may say so, sir, congratulations
on your perfect Hindi, sir.
- Shut up, Wilkins.
- Sorry, sir. Stupid...
He, um, hasn't said a word.
Not yet, anyway.
But I can assure you, sir,
I intend to investigate
this business personally.
All right, Boone.You're a good man.
I will entrust him to your care.
Kindly show the boy some charity.
- Carry on.
- Very good, sir.
You heard the man, Sergeant.
Show the boy some... charity.
Stupid jungly!
- Father?
- Katherine, how are you?
Fine. What is that boy
doing in the dungeon?
Well, it's self-evident. He stole into
the palace and broke into your bedroom.
He's gentle and harmless.
Well, tell that to
Sgt. Harley's sweets.
- I'm sorry?
- Nevermind. Nevermind.
- Anyway, he's Captain Boone's concern now.
- Father, please, listen.
Speaking of Captain Boone,
no news for your old father?
- Father, please.
- Hello, Geoffrey.!
Isn't it all very, very exciting?
Exciting? What?
The boy, Father. He's Mowgli.
Mowgli? Mowgli, the boy...
Your little friend?
No, it couldn't possibly be.
He's was five years old.
No child could survive in the jungle.
Not for ten minutes, much less...
It's your mother's bracelet.
I gave this to you when you were...
Yes, and I gave it to a small boy
named Mowgli. Remember?
Could it be him?
Well, it's our duty to help him.
Be a fascinating case study,
Geoffrey.
You know, chart his development, his
ability to learn language, to reason.
Find out the effects of growing up
away from civilization. It's...
- A unique scientific...
- Opportunity!
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
- Thought this out, haven'tyou?
- Just came to us.
Spontaneously.
What am I supposed to do?
Invite him for the weekend?
Well, we've been preparing a place
for him outside in the garden shed.
So he won't feel so confined.
Of course. Just came to you.
Splendid!
Where did you get the dagger?
Harley, my dull friend,
your Hindi is worse than your breath.
- He's really something, this one, isn't he?
- He's an animal, isn't he?
Hello, William,
John, Sgt. Harley.
- Miss Katherine!
- Katherine. What are you doing down here?
Dr. Plumford and I believe your new prisoner's
the jungle boy the villagers all talk about.
- The one raised by the animals?
- Yes.
We want to help him re-enter
man's world, teach him to speak.
But he's vicious and uncivilized.
Then we'll make him civilized.
What did you do to him?
He did it to himself.
We tried to stop him.
He has, miss. He's done it to himself.
He's mad, you see.
Don't put your fingers in there, miss.
He'll bite them off.
Mowgli.
K-Kitty?
Shh. Billy.
If he can be taught to speak,
then he can be made to talk.
Come on, Mowgli.
Come on. Good. Nice hot English
bath for you. You'll enjoy it.
There's nothing to be scared about.
Splendid.
All right, then.
All right, then.
Thank you.
Hey!
Hey!
Ah, look.
- "A."
- "A."
- "B."
- "B."
- "C."
- "C."
O, P, Q Rrr, Sss, T, U, V.
- No, no, no! Clockwise.
- Clockwise.
Clockwise.
- Engine.
- En-gine.
- Fire.
- Fire.
- Pass.
- Pass.
Road, people, roof,
window and door.
Next. Ah. Lots of water.
Boat. Boat.
- Boat.
- Good, Mowgli. Well done.
Lake. R... Mowgli!
Next.
- Prince Albert.
- Prince Albert.
- Al-bert.
- Albert.
- Albert.
- Albert!
- These are animals.
- These are animals.
Animals are our friends.
Animals are our frien...
What friend?
I'm your friend and, uh,
Dr. Plumford's your friend.
Tongue depressor. Also friend.
Birds are beautiful.
Birds are b-ful.
- Dr. Plumford, please.
- Kitty, I'm trying to examine him.
- Kitty is pest.
- Pest.
- You see? He understands.
- You is pest.
No, no. You are pest.
You are pest.
- Are, are, are. Ahhh.
- Are, are, are.
Ah-ahh-ahhh-ah.
Good.
Birds are beautiful.
Birds are beautiful.
So is you.
So are you.
Yes.You are.
Thank you.
Picking up fast, isn't he?
Where are we going?
Animals are friends.
Isn't that the same bear you fought?
Saving my life?
Baloo?
Yes, Baloo.
Right hand goes here.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
It's all right.
Man, woman,
woman.
One man, two women.
Lucky man.
Good.
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Horse, saddle, temple, river Doctor!
This big tree...
No, that's not a boat.
That's Queen Victoria.
House, iron, jump, king.
Lamp, mail, quick, royal, victory.
- Extra, yellow, zebra.!
- Very good!
So, can you speak with the animals?
Yes, but they speak not as men speak.
With animals, every move, every look,
every sound has a meaning.
- Aha.
- The jungle speaks to me.
Because I've learned how to listen.
If you could have spoken
to me the first time in the jungle,
what would you have said? Oh!
Did you, uh... Did you feel anything?
Fire.
Fire?
A great fire.
Oh.
It's late. We'd better go.
Please, stay here.
With me.
I can't.
There are conventions, formalities,
things that are just not done.
I must do what's civilized.
What must I do?
- Katherine!
- Hello, Father.
Don't you " Hello, Father" me! I've had men
combing the whole bloody district looking for you.
Where were you? You were with
that jungle boy, weren't you?
Mowgli, Father. His name is Mowgli.
Savage! He's bred in the jungle,
raised by animals.
It's not right for a girl of
your standing, of your background.
It's... It's not done. Do you hear?
It's just not done!
What's not done?
I haven't done anything.
- People are beginning to talk.
- Well, people always talk, Father.
I just want what's best for you.
Well, I think you want
what's best for you.
I'm sorry, Father.
Yes, well, so am I.
It's my fault, dragging you
halfway around the world.
Well, I'm thinking... perhaps
it's in your best interest if I...
send you home.
To England? But India's my home.
I love it here.
In England you'd have dozens
of handsome young suitors.
It's time you turned your mind to...
settling down.
- I've plenty of time for that.
- No, no. There's no good reason for you to stay on.
Unless.
Unless, of course,
there's a better offer.
- Hmm?
- Yes, Father.
All right,
what's this all about?
What it is all about,
my good Captain, sahib,
is the lost city of Hunaman.
Yeah, yes, I know the legend.
- It is not a legend!
- Oh, no, sahib. Most certainly it is not.
Many thousand years ago
in the time of Hunaman,
deep in the heart of black jungle,
there was a most magnificent city.
All people in Asia traveling there
for a chance to save their souls.
- Bought their way into heaven, did they?
- Ah, yes.
And the treasures,
they're piling higher and higher.
'Til one day black jungle
is becoming very angry...
and is swallowing the whole city.
And it was lost forever?
And all these centuries, it's been waiting
for the right man to come and find her.
Men like us.
Lots of men have gone
in search of lost city,
but no one is ever returning.
To go into the black jungle is
to invite death. Understand?
Unless, of course, one knows the way.
- The jungle boy!
- Precisely.
But, uh, getting his cooperation...
may take some... persuasion.
What you looking at?
- I have seen that hat.
- That's King Louis of France.
King Louis. If you see him,
tell him I know who took his hat.
I'll do that.
Captain William Boone.
Mind your manners, Mowgli.
Hello, William.
Hello, my dear. I thought
I'd pay you a surprise visit...
seeing as we've been, uh, too busy
to see each other of late.
I brought you these.
I know they're your favorite.
Thank you.
You're very sweet.
So... lessons going well, I hope?
- Very well.
- Good, good.
Attentive fellow, isn't he?
Yes, very.
I've been doing a lot of thinking...
about you and I.
- You have?
- Yes.
And, uh, well...
Katherine Ann Brydon,
will you marry me?
- William, I'm flattered.
- Good. Then it's settled.
- But my father's planning on
sending me back to England...
- Shh.
I've already spoken to your father,
and he feels this is the better offer.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
Then don't say anything.
Oh, Katherine, we shall be the
most perfect couple in all India.
- We'll have success, wealth, power.
- Love?
Yes, yes, that too, of course.
You know, I feel awful. I've been quite remiss
in my duties to you of late, haven't I?
I'll tell you what. Why don't
I take your friend... What's his name?
- Mowgli.
- Mowgli. Mowgli. Yes.
Why don't I take him for a tour of the
palace. You'd like that, wouldn't you?
You know, William, you can be quite
sweet when you put your mind to it.
This one is a personal
favorite of mine.
You, um... You thrust it into your
opponent's belly, like that, you see?
And then you twist it a little...
and you rip out his stomach.
Then do you... eat him?
- No, of course not.
- Does he want to eat you?
Why, no.
Then why kill him?
Because he's your enemy.
What is enemy?
Someone you hate.
What is hate?
Fifteenth century. Smart little
buggers back then, weren't they?
And this one.
- This one belongs to you, doesn't it?
- Mm.
Where did you get it?
- From Monkey City.
- Monkey City?
Was there more treasure there?
More like this?
In Monkey City, there's
mountains of treasure.
Mountains, you say?
I want you to take me to this, um,
Monkey City of yours.
- No!
- No?
For heaven's sake, why not?
Only those who keep
the jungle law may go.
My dear boy, I'm a British officer.
My job is to keep the law.
- You keep not the jungle law.
- Look here.
I don't know about any jungle law,
but I do keep man's law.
And man's law rules around here.
Man has many laws.
Most about killing.
You kill for sport...
and anger and treasure.
The jungle law say
we may only kill to eat...
or to keep from being eaten.
You know, you almost sound like a man,
instead of an animal that's been
trained to sound like one.
The more I learn what is a man,
the more I want to be an animal.
I hunt animals, you know?
Maybe someday...
you hunt me.
Thank you for inviting me,
Dr. Plumford.
Oh, think nothing of it, my boy.
Now, look at that.
The color and majesty of India.
The exquisite manners
and food of England.
All the bare necessities of life.
Oh, incidentally,
I was joking about the food.
Adrian.
My, my, my, but don't
we look dandy tonight?
- What does he think he looks like?
- I'm not entirely sure, Billy.
But perhaps he could teach us
how the apes dance, hmm?
That would be fascinating.
And then we were supposed to name these
monkeys and I couldn't remember the names.
Come on.
May I?
Fascinating. Come, Katherine.
Your father has a little
announcement he'd like to make.
Thank you.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could
have your attention please.
I have an announcement to make.
This evening, to my great
surprise and delight,
one of the finest young men that
I've ever had the privilege to know,
has sought my consent
to marry my daughter, Katherine,
she having accepted his proposal.
Nowadays, of course, parents are
the last to know these things.
Still, never having been one to stand
in the way of progress or true love,
I am glad to give that consent.
And so it is with the greatest pleasure,
that I announce the engagement...
of Katherine Ann Brydon
to Captain William Boone.
A toast...
to Katherine and William.
Katherine and William!
What does this mean, Doctor?
It means, Mowgli, that they are to wed.
It means...
she belongs to him.
Excuse me, Doctor.
Dreadfully sorry, old bean.
Pardon me, old chap.
The poor thing.
Let him go.
Katherine!
Mowgli! Mowgli, where are you going?
- To my home.
- You can't go back.
- You're not an animal. You're a man.
- I am not a man!
And I am not an animal.
Please don't leave.
Why should I stay?
I run with the wolf pack.
You...
must run with the man pack.
It is the proper thing.
I will shame your house no more.
You know, I think you
owe me an apology.
- There's been a mistake, William.
- Mistake?
I can't marry you.
I won't marry you.
No, Katherine!
I think it is you who is mistaken.
I realize this adolescent infatuation you
have with this savage has addled your brain,
but I can't allow you to make a fool of me and I
will not lose you to some puerile jungle boy!
You sure you won't reconsider?
After all, Captain Boone is...
No, Father.
Ah, well.
Sure you'll be very happy in England.
Yes, I'm sure I will be.
I shall miss you dreadfully.
We're ready.
Well, then, where do you suppose
my little brown brother has got to?
Oh, nothing personal.
Keep your eyes open, laddies.
A bob for the man that spots him.
Ahhh! Me sweets!
Baloo?
Baloo?
Dr. Plumford.! Dr. Plumford.!
Where's the doctor?
They just left to bring Miss Katherine
to the ship to England.
- Where?
- They're on the road to Jaipur.
Go on.
Hyah!
You'll absolutely love their house.
Right across from Holland Park.
- Bloody hell!
- Bandits. Get down.
What's happening?
Make room! Return fire!
- Father! Doctor, help him!
- Geoffrey?
Farewell, sahib!
You!
Mowgli!
Why did they do this?
They want me to come for her.
They know I'll come for her.
You saved my life, Mowgli.
Yes, Doctor.
Now I need you...
to save the life of another.
You bloody swine! Leave her alone!
Ow! Get off me!
- Rememberme, Colonel, sahib?
- Let me go.!
Yes, I remember you.
Buldeo, you bloody coward!
Let me go!
- Hello, darlin'.
- Sergeant Harley.
Aye. Look who's here, lad.
Hello, Katherine.
- Looks like the last dance belongs to me.
- Will you sh...
Captain Boone, thank God!
What is he doing here?
That wasn't part of the plan,
now was it, Buldeo?
- It was a mistake.
- Captain Boone.
Am I to understand
you're with this scum?
Much to my surprise, sir.
I have many friends in low places.
Sgt. Harley?
I've had 25 years of the likes of you
without making a penny from it,
so don't you Sgt. Harley me,
you silly wee man!
My God! I've never heard such
insubordination! Lieutenant Wilks?
It's Wilkins, sir. Look,
I know this looks bad, sir.
Oh, shut up, Wilkins.
Look here.
You're all soldiers in the British Army.
You're under my command, and I order
you to return to the fort immediately!
To be hung, drawn or quartered?
No, no, I'm afraid that won't do at all.
- This is treason!
- No.!
Oh, God, now we're in it.
- Ah! You woman, you!
- How could you do this?
But you don't know what's
at the end of the rainbow, my sweet.
- Why have you brought us here?
- I will answer that!
Ah... right on time.
Come down here.
Or else unpleasantries may occur.
Tabaqui! Schula!
- This is good!
- Take us to the treasure and she'll live.
I will take you there,
and we will see who lives.
Why do you suppose
he stares at us like that?
Because to him... you are food.
Oh, good.
My God! Listen to that.
Aw, are the noises bothering you,
sonny?
Can't you get 'em to shut up?
A man talking to animals?
Is this done?
If we don't get my father to a doctor,
he'll die.
He's a British officer. He can make do.
So, my jungle friend,
where do we go from here?
Follow the mountains.
- And then?
- And then, if you are still alive,
I will tell you more.
Shut up.
Shut up.
- Shut up!
- Aye. Shut up.
Calm yourself, Wilkins.
What's that?
How the hell should I know?
Never heard anything like that in my life.
It is Shere Khan. He's returning.
Good. I'd like to bag me a tiger.
Do not be wishing for this tiger, sahib.
He's the devil.
Shere Khan hunts us.
I must protect you from him.
I must escape.
- We're going with you.
- No.
It's safer with
these men and their guns.
Be careful.
I will come back for you.
I know.
Oh, stop.
Ah! He's escaped!
Wake up! He's escaped!
No, no. No, no!
Boone, help me! Boone! Wilkins!
- Somebody help me.!
- Harley, what are you doing in there?
It's quicksand, Wilkins!
It's sucking me down.
- It's got my legs! It's sucking me under!
- Gimme your hand!
Get Gimme your hand!
- Stretch to me. Come on.
- Gimme your hand, Wilkins!
- Come on, reach!
- I can't.

Bane of my existence.
This'd be a damn fine country if it
wasn't for all the bloody elephants.!
Now this is just great.
Great.!
Just... Just be careful
with that thing, will you?
Bloody oaf!
"Join the army" they say.
"See the world" they say. This is
singly the most ridiculous thing...
I've ever done in my life.!
Once I get back to soci
Ow.!
Bloody mosquitoes.!
Bloody jungle.!
Bloody jungle.!
My father lives.
What a shame.
Well, shall we continue?
Kill him.
Mowgli.!

He won't let me die.

- Behave yourself and I won't.
Follow him!
Follow King Louis to your treasure.
Damn.
See, Katherine?
It's not all that disgusting.
It's not the place,
It's the company.
It's beautiful.
Brilliant.
- Mowgli!

I'm knowing you are down here,
my little man cub.!
Huh?
My leg!

Help me!
Buldeo?
Buldeo?
No!
So, you've returned
to seal your fate, have you?
Friend of yours?
Aha.
Oh, dear.
What do you think you have
that I don't, huh?
Strength of a bear.
- Speed of a panther.
- No!
- No.!
- Heart of a wolf!
And very sharp teeth.
Oh.
Kitty, come! We must go quickly!
- We have to take some with us.
- This treasure only brings death!
- Just one thing.
- Please.
Katherine.!
Look what we can have together.
Katherine, come back.!
All right, go then! Go!
Go with your jungle boy.!
I got what I came for.!
I don't need you.
What's happening?
Shere Khan sees me not as a man,
but as a creature of the jungle.
Hello.
Look who's here.
Baloo.
He was a very good patient.
Hmm? Yes, you are.
Look!
So that is how it came to pass,
that Mowgli, keeper of the jungle law,
protector of creatures great and small,
became lord of the jungle.
So listen well and hear the call...
and long life to those
that keep the jungle law.

During my life I have always lived in the city.
I'm Max. And I am the luckiest dog in the world.
Because of her. That's Katie.
Katie and I, well, we have the perfect relationship.
We met a few years ago.
And, well, let me tell you, we have directly matched quickly.
You know, it is a relationship where you know immediately.
And listen to this, he was looking for a roommate, and so do I.
So I immediately moved in the same day.
It was perfect.
Since that time we were always together.
Katie will do anything for me.
And I was a loyal patron.
Love us .. we love, how can I describe it ..
Our love is bigger than words.
Or shoes.
It's just me and Katie.
Katie and me.
Us against the world.
I'm not going to say this soul mate, even for a sane person would say so.
There's only one small problem ..
- Almost every day, he always goes. - Come on, Max.
- See you tonight. - Sometimes I do something to keep him here.
Okay. Sit. Spinning.
Talk. Oh, okay. Good dog.
But it never works.
Where is he going?
Well, what would he do?
Oh, I really miss him.
Wow, the house, he's back.
I forgot my cell phone.
Why are you so long, why did you? Oh, right.
Oh, I really miss him.
Dah, Gidget. Be a good dog.
- Hei, Max.
- Hei, Gidget.
There are plans for today?
Yes, today I had a great plan. I have big plans, I'll sit here, and I'll wait for Katie back.
Gee, that sounds interesting. Well, I will not bother you. I also had big plans today.
This is it. Until later Chloe.
Dah, Pepe.
Bye, Mel.
Bye, Sweety.
Bye, Gina.
Bye.
I'll miss you, Shelly.
Bye, Runty.
See you all.
Dah ..

[ROCK MUSIC]
- Hei, Max.
- Hei, Chloe.
Do you know they will go anywhere today?
You know what I just .. I do not care.
Maybe it's different for you, but me and Katie have a different relationship.
You know, you are a cat. Maybe that's why.
Because no one likes cats if they like dogs, that's all.
Maybe that's why.
Say it in your own self.
You, Max.
Hey, friends.
Howdy, Sweet Pink.
Hey, where have you been, man?
Oh, listen to this. Yesterday my owner gave me a white pill meal.
I began to feel groggy the next I knew I was in the air.
- Wait a minute, in the air? - Yeah, suitcases they exist everywhere.
- Scattered everywhere. - Oh, come on.
- Koper they are in the air? - Then it hit me,
And when I woke up, I felt lighter.
Eh, it's not likely to happen.
I would not want to eat a pill like that again.
I did not know it was covered by the beans.
Because, come on .. the beans.
- Hi, friends .. - Oh, hey, Norman.
You're still looking for your apartment?
Yes. It's been three weeks now. Is this the second floor or the third floor?
I do not know any numbers, but you do not live here.
Oh, shit. See you again.
You know, you can do it.
He could not do it.
Friend, there's you .. Did you find it?
You know I've found it.
This is it.
- Ball! - Ball, ball, ball.
Katie will be very happy. This is football.
I have searched for. It is appropriate, it is a great fit in my mouth.
She was!
No ball like this in the city.
I assure you, this is the ball.
- Hey. - Katie.
I'm home, Max.
Hey, Max, how's your day, pal?
You're a good dog.
Yes, I'm very happy to see you, man.
Okay, man, calm down. It was not anything. Take it easy.
Now I have great news.
I know this will take some time to get used to you.
But .. But I think it will be a very good thing ..
Max, this is Duke.
He will be your brother.
No, no, Max. Okay.
It will be fine, Duke.
This is not nothing.
Oh, look .. he loves you.
Yeah .. look around you.
I know, man. It takes time. But he has no home.
So you and I will take care of him.
Okay?
Oh God .. Duke find your ball is lost. That would be very nice.
I love you, Max.
I love you, Duke.
Sleep well.
Hey .. friends.
The place is very nice.
Yes.
By the way, it is a nice bed.
Yes. It is okay.
Maybe we could share.
You know, one night you sleep in the bed.
and the next night I slept there.
- Like that. - This is my bed.
You sleep in the old blanket. It's worth with you.
You are the worthy old dog sleeping in an old blanket.
Oh, waw .. you're stubborn.
Hey, I understand. I'm also stubborn.
But we must learn to share.
- Wait, what are you .. - Maybe we can both sleep here.
- No, wait. - Perfect.
- It feels good, does not it? - No.
I feel comfortable.
Duke had messed up our lives. This is an emergency.
You must get rid of the dog, he had stolen ..
And he's scary and he's scaring me and he was greedy.
Oh, you sweet dog.
We'll play tomorrow, okay? Okay, go to sleep.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Before I answer your question, I want to know how much did you hear?
So you want to be like that, apparently.
Oh, now you're making me angry.
And when I feel angry .. I'm doing this.
And I want to do that. I need this place.
And if it should be the one between you and me, it was definitely me being here.
Good morning, Max. Max, what are you doing?
Chloe .. Chloe, Chloe. I had a bad situation.
Katie has brought a new puppy from this city.
He said he is my brother, I do not want you.
And now I do not even have beds.
I slept on the floor. Like a dog. Why is Katie doing this on me?
Because he is a human being affectionate dog, Max.
And affectionate dog doing strange things in different ways.
Like .. they like dogs than in cats.
Okay, please do not start it again now. It did not help.
Max, come on .. I was your friend.
Okay? Because I'm your friend, I'll be honest with you. And I do not care about you and your problems.
But .. if you do not do something about him, and soon ..
Your perfect human life with a stupid ending.
- Forever. - Forever?
Forever. Yeah, that's what I .. why it stuck in my nails.
Listen .. if you want to position your back, you have to start acting like the alpha dog.
Correct. Alpha dog. I can do that.
- Please do not go. - Okay, okay. This time please do not go.
- I'm running late. I have to go. - Wait! Wait..
Fixed look at me. Spinning, I was doing the rounds.
You're okay here. See you again.
- Wait, no, no .. - Okay, Max.
I know .. Oh, Katie .. Thank God you're home .. I tried to stop him,
But he's crazy.
- Now sit down. - Okay. Okay. Okay.
Lie down.
Children who are good.

Everything takes practice.

I used rabbit magician for children's parties.
But then, the rabbit trick failed.
So what did my master? My Lord, leave me magic and disappear.

Uh-huh, I live in a tattoo,
first people who practice I often use as a training tool.
Until they get to the space.
I mean, yes, people say they love us.
But then they turned and threw us out like garbage.
That's right, is not it? Marcus.
Hey, this is not our fault if we do not look like you.

Do not look at him, look at me, there is no one who can help you.
There is where the Max!

As proof of your loyalty, you will receive a sting from one canine, rattlesnakes blonde.
as a symbol of anti-human!
Who wants to go first?
- Uh, here's the problem, I mean, it's .. well .. - A small dog.
What should I call you little dog? It suits you, more or less so.
Listen, between you and the dog fat ..

Tell me you get the picture.
- Of course I got it. - Hello Peanut, what you see Pops?
Yes, she was there.
- Marshmelow..
- Hai Pops!
- Sweet potatoes. - Pops!
Who is that? What?
Oh hei Buddy.
How are you?
Paralyzed.
Nice. Mr. Pops, our friend Max was abducted, the last we heard she was in the gutter.
Buddy said that if possible, you can help us?
You know I did know the people in the gutter. Well, I do not go out anymore.
Disposing waste of time.
- Who said that? - Oh, I said it, I did not mean to offend.
- I just .. Did you see yourself? - Wah, wah, wah ..
Look what we got here. I want to see it.
Miron, alis!
Oh no..
Oh yes, I like what I see.
All I can see is, a cat charming.
Miss, this is my town, I'll find your friend.
Well, the party is over.
Miron, vakum.
So where are you from my beautiful angel?
- Dude I'm a cat. - Well no protest.
I am very hungry.
Ah man, look at the sandwich.
Correct.
Time to work.
No .. no ..
Ok .. All will be fine. We could find their way home.
We are descendants of the mighty wolf.
We have wild instincts.
Which soon will take over, and take us home.
I can not wait, it is!
Anything?
No.
Wait!
There is no.
I do not know Duke, perhaps the legend that dogs originated from wolves was wrong.
I mean, maybe one puppy asks, where we come from.
And his mother said, Wulff, and the boy was like, oh wolf?
- And he said, yeah right. - Sausages!
Huh?
You smell that?
- Oh man. It is .. - Sausages!
Then what are we waiting for?
We are going toward you dear!
Lower the ladder.
Who are they?
It is a fur ball, and the face of the box.
Wiener dog, yellow birds, and eagles, big rats.
And of course my girlfriend Rhonda.
100 percent wrong.
Quite good.
Come on, let's go.
Every instinct my bird, says do not follow the dog using the wheel.
Uh .. Mr. Pops, do not we need to go into the ditch?
If we take these people will take one day to get there.
You've probably got a lot of lives but to me every breath is a gamble.
So we have to take this secret service.
Okay, these are the secret of death.
Well, that's enough I think.
Come on!
Down here!
Help me?!
Keep moving.
Oh no.
Stop it! Look away!
Come on, I do not have all day.
Come on slow!
What smell is this?
It is a waste disposal site.
The aroma is getting stronger.
Oh my goodness.
Duke, let's eat!
Oh ya!
Oh, the aroma is very tasty!
Oh ya!
Sausage!
Come on, friends!
Demi Snetzel!
# We are always together!
# We are always together!

# We are always together!
You know a place where strange friends.
Well, these people are the masters here,
so let me do the talking.
Hey, you whiny, where red Viper?
Do not go Viper! You'll never forget me!
You will be remembered, Viper!
And if you do not believe, you can see a plan tempurku, here.
Boss, I do not understand what it was.
You must be careful to be able to understand.
It you here and here is Brooklyn.
That's where we'll get anjingya. Bam, bam!
Fur ball was indeed a bit crazy.
Let's go from here.
You heard what I said, I will come to the little dog.
And the dog is brown fat, I also will come.
- Small dog? - There are a lot of small dogs in the city.
I mean you're also a small dog. So let's go.
He also said anjinig brown fat.
That fits with our new room comrades.
Not really.
Max, Max, Max, Max, Max,
you'll get it!
It was hard to argue with.
Hey, you stay away from ..
Wait, what? You know that little dog?
He is my friend. And some say he was my boyfriend.
Nobody said that.
I can not believe you know the little dog.
The world is so small, it's a funny thing ya.
Catch!
Let's go!
Not good!
I'll see ya later.
It all makes!
Derrick, you're stupid! Are they all blurred?
That was almost alone!
Oh sial!
Yes, we got one!
Oh good for you guys!
Oh yes, the little dog, we get a neighbor.
Derrick in the mouth!
Just ignore what just happened, okay?
Ya!
Do you know? I mean it may chatter sausage, but you're okay.
That's right folks!
You know when you first met me like 'oh I do not like it' '.
But now that I've known I was like 'I love her!' '.
You know I've seen this place from the outside.
If I knew what treasures that are here, I'm going to break down the door of her from the first.
What are you talking about?
Pemilikku used to live here.
Dude, wait, you said you used to have an owner?
Well, it's been a long time, I do not want to talk about it.
Yes talk, come on!
I do not know..
but what do you know? He used to be very cool.
Ya?
Yes, he's the best.
And we have fun.
We played catch throwing!
Our streets!
We both slept. We both like to sleep.
I went out one night, chasing butterflies or car.
When I catch it and eat it ..
Then maybe butterflies.
I know I've gone too far from home and I can not go back.
A few days later I was arrested animal control.
My past was great, but ..
I've blown it.
Duke, we have to go to your house!
- No. - You know, your master will be pleased.
Really? But he never find me.
Maybe he .. he does not like me.
Of course he likes you, he is your master.
I mean maybe she is very worried.
- I do not know. - I know, and we'll find.
Your master will be pleased, I've just loved the thought.
Okay.
Let's do it.
There they are!
Let the dog, come here.
You think you're going where?
Do not!
Rabbit, he and his crazy eyes!
No one knows what's wrong with that thing!
Listen, this is my opinion.
Maybe there's a dog in the neighborhood that are similar Max.
Begin acquainted with them, after a while you will forget him.
We will not give up, we are dedicated, we are loyal, we are the best pets.
We are a dog!
- Cat. - Eagle.
Congratulations! Today you are a dog, whether you like it or not.
Nice.
Now let's find the rabbit Max before it.
Let's go!
Hey, this is ...
Damn it.
Well, they're here.
Nice. We're close. It is dasarjahat action, people.
- Destruction. - This is it. That.
- I know. - Hey. Here, I think ..
Oh, lightweight bombs just melt my brain.
The hare had an idea.
Okay, so, how do I look?
You look great.
- How do I smell her? - Like a dog, pal.
Relaxed, buddy.
There it was.
Well, there. Scratching the door.
Remember the sausage factory? It was fun, right?
Are you step-back?
No, why do you think so?
Let's walk to talk about what you think I reverse-reverse?
Friend, you do not have anything to be nervous. They will be glad to see you.
Okay.
A new car.
Can I help you?
No, we're good. thanks.
You're not good, you look gross. I have to ask again, away from my place.
Before I became dumb. You know. What are you already.
- This is my house. - Buddy, maybe we should go.
And why, why Fred wanted a cat? He hates cats.
It is one of the things I liked about him.
Fred, the old people? He..
She died.
Duke, maybe I made a mistake here. Come on, let's go.
You are a liar. Cats can lie all the time.
Do not blown it.
Who are they?
Hey, this is my home. Go.
Duke, it's time to go.
Duke, let's go. Come on. It's not your house anymore.
- Why did you bring me here, Max? - Wait a minute. It is my fault?
- You know, I'm trying to help you. - You're trying to get rid of me.
Yes, you know what, Duke. I do not need this. I .. See you later.
Wow. Wow. Come on, calm down.
Go home, Max.
- Hey, help me here. - Hold, here I come.
Time to take you, big fella. Come on. Just it. You.
Duke!
Oh, the house-house-house.
Small dog.
Ya!
Oh, are you kidding?
You think this is over, the little dog?
- Attack karate! - Wait!
You do not! Can you get away from me!
Tattoo?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

You're driving like an animal.
- What is that? You rammed it intentionally. - Oh, it was a hole.
You do not know me very well, OTD.
I always check.
Did you see Van her?
That is all. We're going to hit.
Relaxed, Snowball, I got you.
There he is!
She caught Snowball.
Yey!
Look, pal. This is not apparently.
Shut up.
You will take the boss.
No, no, no. Snowball and I were in the same time now.

Yes, I, I just want to ..
See, what you lived by the person throughout life.
But you do not appreciate them up.
I did not know until he beat up dozens of animals at the Brooklyn Bridge.
I guess, I am trying to say is .. If you want to ..
- Okay. - Oh, great. You're in love.
All repugnant to everyone. Let's go!
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.
Does anyone know where we are?
- Goodbye, Max. - Goodbye, Gadgets.

- Hey! - Hey!
There they are! Max and Duke. Come here.
As usual. So how?
Great right? I..
Ah. So maybe some. But I knew this would work.
So, who's hungry?
Welcome home, Duke.
Thank you, Max.

There was a time above...
A time before...
There were perfect things.
Diamond absolutes.
But things fall...
Things on Earth,
and what falls...
- ...is fallen.
- Master Wayne. Bruce!
Bruce, are you alright.
Martha...
In the dream
they took me to the light.
A beautiful lie.
- Jack.
- Bruce.
Jack, listen to me.
I want you to get everyone
out of the building. Right now.
You understand?
Let's go.
Come on, start moving now, people.
Let's go.
The boss wants us out
of the building.
So, let's make it happen.
Jack.
Jack!
We're sorry.
All services are busy now.
Will you please try
you call again later.
Heaven god.
Creator of heaven and earth.
Have mercy on my soul.
JACK!!!
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne!
I can't feel my legs.
- I can't feel my legs.
- We need help over here!
Help me.
I can't feel my legs.
You're going to be okay,
you hear me?
Wallace.
What do they call you, Wally?
Huh?
You're the boss, Boss.
Alright.
- You're going to be okay.
- Easy, easy.
Come on.
Oh my god.
I can't feel my legs.
I can't...
I can't feel my legs.
It's okay.
You're going to be okay.
You're okay, alright.
Huh.
Okay, you know what?
We're going to find your mom.
Where is she?
18 MONTHS LATER
NAIROBI, AFRICA
Are you a terrorist, general?
They did not tell me
the interview was with a lady.
I'm not a lady,
I'm a journalist.
What I am,
is a man with nothing,
except a love of my people.
Uh, don't open...
You just exposed...
Who's paying for these
security contractors, general?
Who pays for the drones that
passed over our heads at night?
One question begs another.
Yes?
CIA.
They're tracking us.
No!
Not her.
We just used her credentials as cover.
She doesn't know anything.
It's okay, Lois.
I...
I didn't know.
Ignorance is not the same...
as innocence.
Miss Lane.
Get up!
Stand up!
Move out!
Take 1 step,
you will see the inside of her head.
The women in the village
heard a noise.
Like the sky crack open.
He came down, so many dead.
Even worse came after.
The government attacked.
No mercy in the villages.
My parents tried to run...
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do,
that...
no one has asked what he should do.
Let the record show that
this committee holds him responsible.
He'll never answer to you.
He answers to no one.
Not even I think, to god.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was going to cook.
Surprise you.
They held hearings about what happened.
- They're saying that...
- I don't care.
I don't care
what they're saying.
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot
- Think of what could have happened.
- Well, think about what did happen.
I didn't kill those men if
that's what they think.
If that's what you're saying?
I'm saying I want to
understand what happened.
I'm saying,
thank you for saving my life.
I'm saying there's a cost.
I just don't know
if it's possible.
Don't know what's possible?
For you to love me and be you.
Clark, you're going to
flood the apartment.
Mmm-hmm.
There has been a report of screaming
at location 1939 Harbor Way
Possible shots fired.
Go.
It saved us.
A devil.
It's okay.
It's okay.
We're-We're going to help.
It saved us.
Okay, we're going to
get you out of here.
Okay?
It's still here.
I - I don't understand.
AH!
Christ!
I saw him.
I never saw him before.
I didn't know...
You almost took my face off.
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?
Oh.
Jesus Christ.
He branded him.
Still working.
You're getting slow in
your old age, Alfred.
It comes to us all,
master Wayne.
Even you got too old to die young,
and not for lack of trying.
Funnel, fairy, bubblebath.
Funnel, fairy, bubblebath.
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.
It's this new layer or armor.
I'll just have to rewire.
So...
last night was productive?
Nope. He's too low level,
he knew nothing.
This, is a man who knows things.
Anatoli Knyazev.
He's Russian.
Contracts all over the globe but
he's base out of the port of Gotham.
Weapons and human trafficking.
So, the "White Portuguese" is a Russian,
that's the theory.
No.
The theory is that the Russian
lead me to the man himself.
If he is indeed a him.
You don't know if he exist.
He could be a phantasm.
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?
Ah, high state front.
New rules.
We're criminals, Alfred.
We've always been criminals,
nothing's change.
Oh.
Yes it has, sir.
Everything's change.
Men fall from the sky.
And gods hurl thunderbolts.
Innocents die.
That's how it starts.
The fever, the rage,
the feeling of... powerlessness
that turns good men...
cruel.
Justice turn dark across the harbor
when police found an alleged sex trafficker
apparently tortured and branded
by the Gotham bat.
The man is the second criminal
found baring the bat brand.
The first victim, an accused child predator
later was assaulted in prison
and remains in critical care
from his injuries.
One source tells Metropolis,
that many believed
the mark of the Bat brand in prison
essentially is a death sentence.
In other news, the mayor
has announced that Metroplis...
Frank, your D!
(Defense)
Woo.
Ah!
A hoi hoi.
I didn't know you were here.
- Man on the marquee.
- Stop, don't believe it.
My father named the company after himself.
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Oh, really great.
Really great?
Good. Good.
Uh.
Follow me.
You know, Dad was born
in east Germany.
He grew up eating uh...
stale crackers.
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade
and waved flowers at tyrants.
So, I think it was providence
that his son,
me, would end up with this.
One of my rebuild Metropolis crews
found it.
A little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.
What's a rock have to do
with Homeland Security.
Homeland Security?
Mmm.
No, no, no... ma'am.
Planetary Security.
The fragment is of a
radio active Xeno mineral
We suspected it might have
bio interactions,
so, we took the sample
to AMRIID.
Where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.
And, when we exposed
general Zod to the mineral,
this happened.
Profound biodegradation,
decaying Kryptonian cells.
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized,
if a large enough
sample was found.
And then, among the fishes,
a whale!
Lying at the bottom
of the Indian Ocean
Emerald City.
Beautiful.
Now, Rocky is radio active, but,
what he needs from you
is an import license.
And why would we
want to weaponize this material?
As a deterrent.
A silver bullet to keep in reserve
to use against the Kryptonians.
So, the day doesn't come, Madame.
When your children are waving daisies
at a reviewing stand.
Last I looked,
the only one of those
flying around up here
was Superman.
Ha.
Yes, Superman.
Yeah, but, there are...
there are more of them.
- The meta-human thesis.
- Yes, the meta-human thesis.
More likely than not.
These exceptional beings live among us.
The bases of our myths.
Gods among men upon our...
our little blue planet here.
You don't have to use
the silver bullet,
but, if you forge one...
Well, then...
We don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.
Sir.
Get down.
Sir, I said, get down, now!
Can we get some backup here?
Hey. Hey.
Don't do it!
HEY!
Lois.
Crime Lab, on 3.
This is Lane.
Kent, you're sports today.
I want you to follow
up on the football.
Underdog dreams dashed
10 yards between Gotham and glory.
Hey.
Are you guys watching this?
Emergency responders quickly created a
precautionary perimeter around Heroes Park
while they brought the man down
from this beloved monument.
The suspect has been identified
as Wallace Vernon Keefe.
I work for Bruce Wayne!
I work for Bruce Wayne!
There'll be arraign on charges of
vandalism, resisting arrest
FALSE GOD - and a felony charge
of making terrorist threats
that carries up to
40 years in prison.
Poor son of a bitch.
- Jenny.
- Mm?
Headline.
"End of love affair
with man in the sky?"
Okay.
There're ways
we can help each other.
Ah.
Could you step
into my office here?
Yes!
What's your wish list?
Uh.
Access to the wreck of the
crashed Kryptonian ship.
Done.
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.
You want Zod's body?
Okay.
It's cherry.
- Show him what you got!
- Dude, let's go!
Make sure to hit his left.
Come on.
Throw a punch, will you?
Let's go!
Come on!
Thank you.
The house treats luck like an insult.
Good luck for one has always
gives others misfortune.
But, eventually,
all accounts will be settled.
3 nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,
the line was all she tell me.
Not all I'm sure.
Good evening.
DEVICE CLONING
SUCCESSFUL
It's like a 1 man reign of terror.
This bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port
and the adjacent projects
and tenements.
And as far as I can tell
the cops are actually helping him.
Crime wave in Gotham.
Other breaking news.
Water, wet.
- Did you file the football yet?
- Why aren't we covering this?
Poor people don't buy papers?
People don't buy papers,
period, Kent.
Perry, when you assign a story, you're
making a choice about who matters...
- ...and who's worth it.
- Good morning, Smallville
The America conscious died
with Robert, Martin and John.
Sorry.
Sorry.
No match.
My guys in the crime lab,
never seen one before.
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with it.
Recovered from the scene
of the fire fight in the desert.
Not sold anywhere commercially
in the world, even black market.
So?
So, who gave prototype military rounds
to tribe fighters in the Sahara.
The ass, Lois.
Flight to DC tonight,
a couple of days there.
Go.
Coach.
No extra leg room.
Economy plus.
Coach!
Senator.
My dad always said that,
Kentucky mash
was the secret to health.
This was his room.
I left it just the way it was.
It's silly.
The magical thinking of orphan boys.
I'm blocking the import license
for your mineral.
The Red Capes are coming!
The Red Capes are coming!
You and your hearings...
galloping through the streets
to warn us.
One, if by land.
Two, if by air.
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?
- Can I call you June?
- You can call me whatever you like.
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's peach tea.
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.
You won't fool a fly on me.
I'm not going to drink it.
Hey, you don't think
Dad would mind, do you?
If I change just...
...just one thing in this room.
Because, that should be upside down.
Now, we know better now,
don't we?
The devils don't come from
hell beneath us. No.
No, they come from the sky.
MARTHA WAYNE
1946 - 1981
Wrong room, miss.
Secretary Swanwick, you haven't been
returning my phone calls.
Miss Lane, if you like an interview,
Major Farris is just outside that door.
You're treating me like a stranger?
I'm treating you like a reporter.
Alright.
Is the US providing experimental
military arms to rebels in Africa?
You know with balls like yours.
You belong in here.
Who's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?
No, not tin, but it's metal.
Fired in the Superman incident.
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.
- We haven't been told the truth.
- Here's the truth.
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.
Superman acted like some... rogue combatant
to rescue her and people died.
Don't invent a conspiracy theory
to put back his halo.
Or yours.
- Major.
- Sir.
Oh.
I hope the next generation of Waynes
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.
Don't think there's a likely
to be a next generation.
Thank you, sir.
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.
Two mentions of business
with the "White Portuguese" and
it's continuing transmitting black out
data to the personal residence
of Alexandra Luthor.
You think Lex Luthor
is the "White Portuguese"?
I can't see that he needs
the income from imported arms.
Regardless, I'll need to
put a 'leech' in his house,
and I'm going to need the suit.
The Bat interrogated 6 people
and came away with nothing.
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.
Bruce Wayne won't have to.
He's been invited.
HA HA HA Joke's on you BATMAN
- That's him right there!
- There he is! Get a shot!
- Bruce, over here!
- Bruce, Bruce.
- Wayne, have a shot.
- Mr. Wayne!
- Right here, one second.
- This way, Mr. Wayne!
Who's that?
You must be new to the
let them eat cake beat.
That is Bruce Wayne.
Philanthropist.
Bibliophile.
True friend of the library of Metropolis.
Mr. Lex Luthor.
Nikki.
You're embarrassing me.
Speech. Speech.
Uh, blah blah blah.
Open bar.
The word Philanthropist,
comes from the Greek.
Meaning a lover of humanity
It was coined about,
2,500 years ago...
Alright, where am I going, Alfred?
Approach the elevator,
to your left.
That where it must be.
It's in the service
corridor in the basement.
Go down the stairs.
Prometheus went with us,
and he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy man kind
and for that, he was given a thunderbolt.
Chooo!
Hm.
That seems unfair.
On the serious note,
the library of Metropolis...
Down the stairs.
It's the only way in, down the stairs.
But, at one time,
Dad could not either.
No, my father could not
afford the books, so...
He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.
Now you got the kitchens
on your right.
To the left.
Right in front of you,
that's where you want to be.
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Uh, I just...

I must have...
That last Martini was a...
too too many, I think.
- Men's room is upstairs.
- Great, I'm okay.
I like those shoes.
I can't stay down here, Alfred.
Go upstairs and socialize.
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.
In your dreams, Alfred.
Books are knowledge,
and knowledge is puff worth.
And I am...
Heh heh heh, no.
I, umm.
No, what am I?
Alright, what am I suppose to say?
No.
The bitter sweet pain among man
is having knowledge with no power.
Because...
Because that is paradoxical,
and umm...
Thank you for coming.
Please, drink, it's free.
Mr. Wayne.
Mr. Wayne.
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.
Oh, my foundation has already issued
a statement in support of the... cause.
I'm sorry?
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me, alright?
What's your position on the
bat vigilante in Gotham?
Daily Planet.
Wait, do I own this one?
Or was that the other guy?
Civil liberties has been
trampled on in your city.
Good people living in fear.
Don't believe everything you hear, son.
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.
The Daily Planet criticizing those
who think they're above the laws.
A little hypocritical, wouldn't you say?
Considering every time your hero
saves a cat out of a tree,
you write a puff piece editorial,
about an alien who...
if he wanted to,
could burn the whole place down.
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we can do to stop him.
Most of the world doesn't share
your opinion, Mr. Wayne.
Maybe it's the...
Gotham City and me, we just...
...have a bad history with
freaks dressed like clowns.
Boys!
Mm, Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent.
Ah, I love it!
I love bringing people together!
- How are we?
- Lex.
Hello, good.
Hi, hello.
Lex. It is a pleasure... Ow!
Wow, that is a good grip!
You should,
not pick a fight with this person.
So, after all these years,
we've finally got you over to Metropolis.
- Well, I thought I come drink you dry.
- Well, you're welcome.
You should hop the hub more often though,
I love to show you my labs.
Maybe we could,
be partner on something.
My R&D is up to
all sorts of no good.
TRANSFER COMPLETE
- That's 7 minutes.
Look likes the transfer's complete.
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes.
- The governor.
- Governor.
- Excuse me.
- Next time.
- Governor, hi.
- Lex, it's good to see you.
"... A deadly factory fire has interrupted
the Day of the Dead celebration in Juarez."
Excuse me.
"I can't believe they're
going to let that poor girl die."
We, as a population on this planet,
have been looking for a savior.
90% of people believe
in a higher power.
And every religion believes
in some sort messianic figure.
And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,
we want to make him abide
by our rules?
We have to understand that
this is a paradigm shift.
We have to start thinking
beyond politics.
Are there any
moral constraints on this person?
We have international law.
On this Earth,
every act is a political act.
Is it really surprising,
that the most powerful man in the world
should be a figure of controversy?
To have an individual engaging
in the state level interventions
should give us all pause.
Human beings have a horrible track record
of following people with great power,
down paths that lead to
huge human monstrosities.
We have always created icons
in our own image.
What we've done is we project
ourselves on to him.
The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.
Maybe hes just a guy
trying to do the right thing.
Were talking about a being
whose very existence
challenges our own sense of
priority in the universe.
If you go back to Copernicus,
where he restored
the sun and the center of the
known universe, displacing Earth.
And you get to Darwinian evolution
and you find out,
we're not special on this Earth
we're just one among
other life forms.
And now we learned, that we're not
even special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.
There he is, an alien, among us.
We're not alone.
Are you, as a United State Senator,
personally comfortable
saying to a grieving parent,
"Superman could've saved your child,
but on principle
we did not want him to act."
I'm not saying he shouldn't act.
I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.
What are we talking about here then?
Must there be a Superman?
There is.
Keefe, you made bail.
Open Two.
Who paid?
Who the hell are you?
- Just a man.
- Yeah?
Well, what do you want?
To help you stand for something.
Your 3 o'clock's here.
He made me half a man.
Let me face him.
So, I logged into your drop box
to find a copy.
There's a copy, alright.
But, nothing about football.
Nothing about...
Friends of the Metropolis Library,
just...
The god damn Gotham bat thing,
I told you not to pursue.
The police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.
So could you, if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.
WPA aren't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.
Not in here. Not out there.
You drop this thing.
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.
It's the sword of Alexander.
It's the blade that
cut the Gordian Knot.
- It's a triumph.
- Yes.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.
It's a fake.
The real was sold in '98
on the black market.
- Now it hangs...
- Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Miss.
The other night, you took something
that doesn't belong to you.
Stealing's not polite.
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?
Who are you?
Someone interested in
the same man you are.
Is that right?
I believe Mr. Luthor has
a photo that belongs to me.
Did you get it?
As it happens, no, I didn't.
The data you copied
is military grade encryption.
You know.
I bet with that dress
9 out of 10 men would let you
get away with anything.
But, you're the 10th.
Mmm.
I guess I am the first,
to see through that babe
in the woods act.
You don't know me,
but, I've known
a few women like you.
Oh, I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys:
Born with no natural
inclination to share.
I didn't steal your drive.
I borrowed it.
You'll find it in the
glove compartment of your car.
Mr. Wayne.

Since the age of 7, you have

But you've never been

It's a weapon.
It's a rock.

It is now aboard the White Portuguese

To keep it out of Luthor's hands.
To destroy it.
No.
You're going to go to war?

He has the power to wipe out

And we have to destroy him.
But, he is not our enemy.

SEARCHING FOR TRANSPONDER SIGNAL
LEXCORP RESEARCH PARK
How do we determine what's good?
In a democracy, good is a conversation
not a unilateral decision.
So, I urge Superman, to come to
this hearth of the people tomorrow.
To see those who have suffered.
The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.
And to know what he stands for.
How far will he take his power.
Does he act by our will,
or by his own.
People hate what they don't understand
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.
You're not a killer.
A threat?
I never wanted this world
to have you.
Be their hero, Clark.
Be their monument.
Be their angel.
Be anything they need you to be.
Or be none of it.
You don't owe this world a thing.
You never did.
CIA thinks the desert was a setup.
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.
The bullet?
The metal was developed
by a private company.
What company?
LEXCORP.
Lex Luthor?
He also had private security contractors
in the desert compound.
Go on record.
Not a chance.
It's classified.
I happen to like my job.
It doesn't make sense.
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,
but how could they know
that he'll show up in the...
...in the middle of the desert.
Thank you.
Alright, come on through.
The Senate hearing is expected
to get under way in any minute now.
Of course the big unknown
in all of this is:
Will Superman show up? That is
what they're really waiting to see.
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.
Soledad O'Brien "In the Moment"
Quick question for you.
You're heading in to meet with the
senators. What would you tell them?
Um. I've come here
to tell them to wake up.
This is flesh and blood.
He's delivered a war here.
And this...
This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.
There are plenty of people, sir,
who would say he's their hero.
He is not a hero!
Grace can you get Greg
up here please, right now.
Senator!
Hi, you.
Don't go anywhere.
I want to talk to you.
You know what, Mercy? You go in and...
make sure no one takes my seat.
So, what'd you been up to?
I'm just here to tell my story.
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,
but a certain junior Senator from Kentucky
decided to block it.
Yes, the Chair of the Committee
on Superman is soft on security.
Greg, why hasn't he
been getting our checks?
He is, Mr. Wayne.
He gets a check from the
victims fund every month.
BRUCE WAYNE, OPEN YOUR EYES

Why haven't I seen this?
I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.
And there he is.
Superman is here.
He's actually at the
United States capitol.
This is really a historic moment.
Nor we expect that Superman would give
some kind of a statement to the Senate
to the American people,
and of course to the world.
He's here.
He came.
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ow.
You are going to be on the
hot seat in there, June bun.
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?
It's that power can be innocent.
Good luck.

"And so, we are left to wonder,
" If Superman was aware
of the threat and did nothing,
"was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"
Still no Kent?
"His disappearance raises questions."
No.
"How could he simply have disappeared
at a time when we, as a nation,
need him more than ever?"
WAS SUPERMAN INVOLVED?
Burn him!
Burn him!
Something, isn't it?
We met Kansas, live on a pancake
so we come to the mountains.
All downhill from here.
Down to the flood plain.
The farm is at the
bottom of the world.
I remember one season
water came bad.
I couldn't been 12.
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.
We worked until
I think I fainted.
But we managed to
stop the water.
We saved the farm.
Your grandma baked me a cake.
She said I was a hero.
Later that day we found out.
We blocked the water, alright,
we sent it upstream.
All alike farm washed away.
While eating my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.
I used to hear them
wailing in my sleep.
Did the nightmares ever stop?
Yeah.
When I met your mother.
She gave me faith that
there is good in this world.
She was my world.
I miss you, son.
I miss you too, Dad.
You know you can't win.
It's suicide.
I'm older now than
my father ever was.
This maybe the only thing
I do that matters.
20 years of fighting criminals
amount to nothing?
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.
Pull 1 up, another
grows in it's place.
This is about the future
of the world.
It's my legacy.
You know, my father sat
me down, right here.
Told me what Wayne manor
was built of.
Railways, real estates and oil.
The first generation made their
fortune trading with the French.
Pelts and skins.
They were hunters.
We got to wait for more evidence,
but the question still remains,
where is he?
If Superman was not involved,
If he's got nothing to hide,
then why hasn't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?
Look, you can't...
The knight is here.
Excuse me.
Don't I know you...
Plain lo, in the morning
Lola in slacks.

Mmm.
Come see the view.
Now, the secret is the height.

And you know something about LEXCORP

She's safe on the ground.
How about you?
Close, but I'm not
talking about Lois.
No. Every boy's special lady

must be a witch.

That's right.

If you kill me, Martha dies.
And if you fly away, Martha also dies.
But if you kill the Bat...
Martha lives.
There we go.
There we go.
And now God, bends to my will.
Now the cameras are waiting

Those are Apache helicopters,
they have now just arrived.
The image...
We have uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 news.
Now, it's not clear
what just happened.
What happening there, Alfred?
How best to describe it?
Metropolis airspace has
been closed briefly.
- Excuse me.
- I kindly ask you to stay in your seats.
Excuse me?
Miss Prince?
Sir.
Look, they cleared the city.
Looks like he's taking it into space.
We can go straight to Key RED,
Mr. President.
Not yet.
Are you crazy?
They are high enough and we can
nuke them with no casualties. Sir.
One casualty, Mr. President.
Superman.
God have mercy on us all.
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.
Red Birds,
are armed to deploy, Sir.
Fire at will.
3. 2. 1.
Oh, God.
Projectile 1.
Impact.
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.
That's uninhabited.
Projectile 2.
No apparent re-entry.
Projectile 2?
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 is Superman.
Sir.
It's moving.
The shock waves are getting stronger.
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.
We can't attack.
What're you saying, Calvin?
I'm saying it's unkillable.
- Master Wayne, are you receiving me?
- Alfred.
It's Kryptonian.
Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.
It might, if you have any left.
I only got 1 round left.
The spear.
Alfred, the spear.
It's pure kryptonite.
It's back in Gotham.
If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.
- It would in theory.
- I got to get it to chase me.
Back to the city.
Back to the kryptonite.
Oh, shit.
Why did you bring him
back to the city?
The port is abandoned.
And there's a weapon here
that can kill it.
Did you find the spear?
I've been a little busy.
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.
This thing is from another world.
My world.
I've killed things
from other worlds before.
Is she with you?
I thought she was with you.
Clark.
Clark.
Clark.
Clark.
Are you alright?
I love you.
No.
No, Clark, you can't.
This is my world.
No, Clark, don't.
You are my world.
No.
Please.
Clark!
SUPERMAN DEAD
NIGHT OF TERROR, MORNING OF LOSS
Daily Planet Reporter Clark Kent
Killed Reporting Gotham Battle
Lex Luthor Arrested In Connection
With Capitol Bombing.
Hi.
Clark had this sent here
so he can surprise you.
All the circuses back east,
burying an empty box.
They don't know how
to honor him.
Except as a soldier.
I've failed him, in life.
I won't fail him in death.
Help me find the others like you.
Perhaps they don't want to be found.
They will.
And they'll fight.
We have to stand together.
A 100 years ago
I walked away from mankind.
From the century of horrors.
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.
Man is still good.
We fight.
We kill.
We betray one another.
But we can rebuild.
We can do better.
We will.
We have to.
IF YOU SEEK HIS MONUMEN LOOK AROUND YOU
The others like me.
Why did you say
they'll have to fight?
Just a feeling.
Turn around and face the wall.
Place your forehead
against the wall.
Put your hands behind your back,
so that I can come in
and restrain you.
Whatever you do.
Wherever you go.
I'll be watching.
But, the bells are already been rung,
and they've heard it.
Out in the dark.
Among the stars.
Ding dong, the God is dead.
The bells, cannot be unrung!
He's hungry.
He's found us.
And he's coming!


I'm kinda lonesome back here.
- Little help...
- Just... I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
Excuse me!
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?
Not the daffodil daydream. The girl.
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife. But...
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's
a reason I'm in this cab today.
- Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
- No, my slender, brown friend. Love...
... is a beautiful thing. When you find it,
the whole world tastes like daffodil daydream.
So you gotta hold on to love. Tight!
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.
Sir, what does Ms Mama June taste like?
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is it's bad.
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?
Oh, that's because it's Christmas day, Dopinder,
and I'm after someone on my naughty list.
I've been waiting, 1 year, 3 weeks, 6 days and---
14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
- And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?
- This shit.
Boo!
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.
You're not the only
one with a war to win.
That won't do.
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.
We'd appreciate your patience.
Okay...
We'll deliver in full
the following month.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Fucking mutant!
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!
That's $27.50.
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.
Merry Christmas!
And a convivial Tuesday
and April to you, Pool!
Oh! Oh, hello!
I know, right? Whose balls did I
have to fondle to get my very own movie?
I can't tell you, but it does rhyme
with "Pulverine". And lemme tell you...
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!
Bad guys to kill.
Maximum effort.
Cock shot!
Rich! Corinthian leather!
I'm looking for Francis!
Have you seen this man?
Yanking, yanking!
I've never said this, but don't swallow.
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
Now, breaking news.
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...
Red suit. Deadpool.
Negasonic! Come. We have mission.
Colossus, wait up.
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?
Which benefits, the matching unitards?
The house that blows up every few years?
Please. House blowing up builds character.
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.
Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.
Deadpool may try to break yours.
Hey!
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!
Let's count 'em down!
Shit, motherfucker!
Ten! Shit.
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!
Bad Deadpool.
Seven. Good Deadpool!
Someone's not counting.
Six!
Four...
Gotcha!
Right up main street!
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.
I'm touching myself tonight.
Francis! Francis!
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?
You're not Francis!
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend said this was a
superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kebab!"
Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero.
Anyhow, technically, this is a murder. But some
of the best love stories start with a murder.
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?
- Are you Mr. Merchant?
- The Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!
- Who placed the call?
- I did!
Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty!
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.
That is a no go on the tip-aroo, Jer.
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.
- I dodged a big-time bullet on that one!
- Not, out of the woods yet.
You need to seriously ease up on the
bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier.
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.
- Just look, man, can I have my---
- I will shoot your fucking cat.
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?
Anywho...
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.
And little Megan, she's not made of
money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.
- I'm.....
- A stalker.
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?
Totally done. You should've seen your face!
- I didn't know what to do, I was so scared...
- Soft spot, remember?
Even look in her general direction again and you will learn
in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots, too.
That came out wrong.
Or did it?
Megan.
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.
No friggin' way.
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.
Hey, wait.
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.
Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies
except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.
You'd best hope we never
see your name on a gold card.
(Buck! Liefeld.)
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...
- Hey, I ain't taking any babysitting money,
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?
- You sure?
- Hmm.
For a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded.
Bet you let the kid off easy, too.
He's not a bad kid. Just a little light stalking. I was way
worse when I was his age, travelling to exotic places...
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then..
Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your instagram.
So what were special forces doing in Jacksonville?
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.
I give you, a blowjob. I'm---
- Why do you make me make that?
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.
- Remind me what good will come of this?
- I don't take the shits, I just disturb them.
What you want?
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.
That's a new stool.
Stay the fuck down.
Alright, move, move, move, move.
Buck, go rest.
He's still breathing.
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.
And then die. At the city of Detroit.
Sorry. I wanted to win money.
I never win anything.
- Whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drink's on me!
- Yeah!
Domestic! Nothing imported.
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?
Tight.
- Vanessa.
- Wade.
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?
I'd hit that.
Buck, you'd best apologize
before--- yeah. That.
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.
- Breathe through the nose.
- I don't have a filter between my brain and my...
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!
- Get outta here. Go cast a spell.
- Hey, hands off the merchandise.
Merchandise, huh. So you...
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.
- Rough childhood?
- Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.
Daddy left before I was conceived.
- Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
- Where else do you put one out?
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.
- Uncles. They took turns.
- I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole
of a locked closet which also happens to be my...
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.
You had a dishwasher. I didn't even know sleep. It was
pretty much 24/7 ball kegs, brownie mix and clown porn.
Who would do such a thing?
Hopefully, you. Later tonight?
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.
And a low-fat dessert.
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?
It's time to put
balls in holes.
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.
- You love ski ball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
- That's a tough call.
I just wanna get to know the real you. Not the short-
shorted 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.
Balls in holes.
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.
Okay. Here you go.
I had this sucker for a while.
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.
You are now the proud protector of the planet Arus.
And you, can erase stuff. Written in pencil.
- Milady.
- I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.
How many more minutes
could I get for this?
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.
- 5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.
- Deal. What do we do with the remaining 2:37?
Cuddle?
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?
Happy Valentines' Day.
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.
Happy Lenten.
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!
Happy Thanksgiving.
I love you.
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...
Can I visit you
between the holidays?
That sweater is terrible!
But red looks good on you.
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?
- You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.
- Right.
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.
Will you...
- Stick it up my---
- ...Marry me?
Uh... Jinx?
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.
- They said 1-month salary, so ...
- You mean...
- I do.
- That's my line.
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!
I feel just like a little girl!
- What if I just held on and never let go?
- Just ride the bitch's back like Yoda on Luke.
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!
Perfect.
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.
Here's the thing:
Life is an endless series of train wrecks with
only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness.
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer and
there were all these experimental drugs from Germany...
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.
Me? I'm memorizing the details of her
face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?
Take your time to process this. It's
important not to do anything rash.
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?
"A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W.
Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."
"His form looks good."
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.
Ringing any bells? No?
How 'bout now?
Wade fucking Wilson.
- Well, hello, gorgeous.
- Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar Pei.
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.
You should thank me. Apparently, I've made
you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.
Dad?
I think we can all agree that shit just went
sideways in the most colossal way.
Well, maybe not the most.
Now this, is my most prized possession.
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.
Sounds like you have. Bernadette is not going
anywhere, because you're not going anywhere.
- Drink.
- You're right.
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.
You belong here at home. Surrounded by
your Voltron, and your Bernadette and your me.
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.
Not a good one, like Slapchop,
more Shakeweighty.
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.
We will make you better than better.
- A superhero.
- Look, Agent Smith, I tried the
hero business and it left a mark.
But if I ever hit fuck
-it, I'll look you up.
Oh. Shit.
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...
His drink's on him.
What'd he say?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.
They made 3 of those movies.
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.
But what it does to
the people you love.
Who knew if this guy could save my life? But I
knew there's only one way that I could save hers.
Isn't that what superheroes do?
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.
Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass, local dry
cleaning discounts, lucrative film deals,
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.
Con: they're all lame-ass teacher's pets!
- You know I can hear you.
- Wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.
Stay right here. You've been
warned before, Deadpool.
This is a shameful and reckless use of your
powers. You will both be coming with us.
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the goody
two-shoes bullshit right now. And you are?
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
Negasonic Teenage---
What the shit?!
That's the coolest name ever!
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.
- Let me guess, X-Men left you behind
on what, shit detail?
- What does that make you?
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"
"I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen
silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences."
So what's it gonna be? Long, sullen
silence? Or mean comment? Go on.
- You got me in a box here.
- We can't allow this, Deadpool. Please, come quietly.
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.
That guy was already
up there when I got here.
- Wade, you are better than this. Join us,
use your powers for good.
- Heads up!
- Be a superhero.
- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,
who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland
Mansion of some creepy, old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,
on that day, I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend
request. But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do.
- Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!
- Wade...
- Hey. Hey, Douchepool!
- Zip it, Sinead!
And I hope you're watching...
Quite unfortunate.
That does it!
Canada!
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.
Oh, your poor wife!
You really should stop.
All the dinosaurs fear the T-Rex.
- I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
- This is embarassing.
Please. Stay down.
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?
- Do you have 'off' switch?
- Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?
Enough!
Let us go talk to the Professor.
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!
Oh my God. Nasty.
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
Rock, meet bottom.
When life ends up breathtakingly fucked, you can
generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.
This, well, this was mine.
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.
You've finally hit fuck-it.
- Just promise you'll do right by me.
So I can do right by someone else.
- Of course.
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.
And Jesus! A warmer table.
You should really come up with a safe
word, fellas. I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.
Easy!
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
I'm calling Wang.
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
- Patience, Angel. All in good time.
- Are you here for the turn down service or what?
- We have another talker.
- I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.
Shut the fuck up.
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."
But I'm going blunt. This workshop
is not a government-led program.
It's a private institution that turns reclamation
projects like yourself into men of....
Extraordinary abilities.
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly... Wrong.
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, also scorched
my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.
Thank-- thank you! You
have something in your teeth.
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.
It's been bothering
me for a long time.
Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,
because it sounds suspiciously made up.
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Faulty?
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is your sense of humor.
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.
- He's all yours.
- C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum, so we're gonna have to make you suffer.
If you're lucky, your mutant genes will
activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion.
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.
Until you finally mutate...
... or die.
- You mean like a bucket list?
- Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a
spiff off the Olympic torch.
Acid to me, right after.
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...
Vanessa...
I wanna see Vanessa.
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.
- We're just joking.
- No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions.
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.
F-R-A-N-C-I--- oops!
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.
Why don't you do us all a favor and shut
the fuck up? Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
See, here's the problem with round-the-clock
torture, it's that you can't really step it up from there.
Is that what you think?
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.
What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in
the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
If your brain wave's slowing and you're about
to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2.
If your heart rate slows meaning you're able
to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down.
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?
You still think we're
making you a superhero.
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.
And that's what they'll have you doing. Terrorizing
citizens, putting down freedom fighters.
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.
Wait, wait, wait...
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.
- What have you done to me?
- I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.
But where's the fun in that?
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.
Not because I need to.
Because I want to.
Farewell. Go ahead.
You already smell like shit.
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.
Quick question:
What's my name?
Didn't think so.
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!
What's my name?
Wade...
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.
- She doesn't care what you--- Oh!
- Do you like what you see?
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.
Not gently. He was hate-fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship and that was their only catharsis without violence.
And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the British
shitstick who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone--- Poof!
You gotta do something to remedy this. 'Cause
as of now, you only have one course of action:
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror fims.
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.
Here's what I'm actually gonna do:
I'm gonna work thru his crew until somebody gives up Francis,
force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,
- the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
- Yeah.
- That's good. You should keep it that way.
- What, like, wear a mask?
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.
- That'll do.
- What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...
- ... or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie. Oh, shit.
- What?
- I put all my money on you, and now I
just realized I'm never gonna win the....
- Deadpool...
Captain Deadpool.
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.
To you, Mr. Pool. Deadpool. That
sounds like a fuckin' franchise.
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!
Where's Francis?
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!
Don't make me ask twice.
Where is Francis?
He made me ask twice.
Is the mask muffling my voice?
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Little spider-monkey!
This is confusing! Is it sexist to hit you, is it
more sexist to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!
Donde esta Francesca?
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.
- 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89, about to be 90.
- Mr. Wilson?
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.
- This is not going to end---
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where---
You'll tell me. But first, you might wanna look
away for this. Now this little piggy went to...
Thank you, Agent Smith.
Taxi!
Hop in! Great day for a ride.
And we all know
how this turned out.
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.
There. All caught up.
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.
Like the kind where your year-long plan
ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.
Morning, sleepyhead.
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.
- Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
- You mean my big, rubber, masturbating shoes?
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?
Bactine should do it.
How's that () coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.
You're telling me. I don't mind the ().
It's an improvement on the ().
Anything's an improvement over the ().
I'd taken an () or a () over the ().
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw ().
- Screw, please.
- Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades.
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.
Ta------da...
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.
And I quote, "Looking for roommate, blind, and likes imperfections. Must be good with hands." Or would you rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.
Arm.
Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super
-sexy ex back and prevent this from happening to someone else.
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.
#drive-by.
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.
I only wish I'd heal the same.
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.
- Right. And when he heals?
- He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.
- Tylenol PM?
- It sticks back where you stuck the Bactine.
I raided my stash of wisdom just to take a sec
and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.
But I appreciate the gesture.
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?
About the size of a KFC spork.
I get why you're so pissy, but your mood's never gonna
brighten 'till you find this woman and tell her how you feel.
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. McGoo? She wouldn't
have me. If you could see me, you'd understand.
- Looks aren't everything.
- Looks are everything! Ever heard David Beckham speak?
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium. You think
Ryan Reynolds got this far on a superior acting method?
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...
You're blind.
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this arm plows through puberty
and then I'll come up with a whole, new Christmas day plan.
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.
Go, go, go, go, go...
So the doctor says, the bad news is you don't have
that long to live. So the patient says, how long do I have?
The doctor says, five.
The guys says, five what?
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...
Can I help you ladies?
Oh, I do hope so.
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.
Name of Wade Wilson.
Sorry, I don't know the name.
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.
- I've seen this girl.
- This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around. This
isn't really the place to do something like that.
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?
There's a midnight showing of Blade II.
Thanks for having my back, guys.
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!
- Or as I like to call her, Irony.
- I gotta find her fast, before numb nuts does.
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.
Especially from this angle.
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.
You weak motherfucker!
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.
Here we go.
Maximum effort.
Vanessa!
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about... an old boyfriend?
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.
Like a jigsaw puzzle.
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
- Hey, where did she go?
- I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger.
Motherfucker!
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate---
- Jiminy---- Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking-- find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd with the smiling face and
the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.
- I told you, we're going with the (), not the (),
get it thru your head or get outta Fucktown!
- Shit.
- That's all the pieces in the house.
- No, no, no, come on. Let's go. Cough it up.
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.
25 cal. I like it.
Wade...
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.
Oh, listen, Al...
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere
in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness.
Good luck.
You wanna get fucked up?
Put her down over here.
Go on, then.
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.
I've been trying to tell you assholes you
got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.
- Fake laugh! Hiding real pain! Go get Silver balls.
- You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you. It s almost
like, the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.
My chrome-penised friend back there, has agreed to do me this
solid. In exchange, I said I would consider joining his boy band.
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.
- So, any luck winning Gita back?
- I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool, but Bandu
is more craftier and handsomer than me.
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.
He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, DP, I plan to gut
him like a tandoori fish then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)
He's super dead.
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.
Not often a dude ruins your face, skullstomps your sanity, grabs your baby mama and personally sees thru 4 of your 5 shittiest moments.
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.
Hey, where's your duffel bag?
Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords..
... and maximum effort.
Cue the music.
Wade Wilson!
- What's my name?
- Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for 'ya.
- Go get some.
- Superhero landing. She's gonna
do a superhero landing, wait for it!
Superhero landing! You know, that's really hard
on your knees. Totally impractical, they all do it.
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please----
I mean, that's why I brought her?
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.
Go get her, tiger.
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.
Alright then. Fire!
Finish fucking her the fuck off!
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!
Look away, child. Look away!
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.
So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle, possibly...
... even lover-like treatment.
Fine! Commando!
Teabag!
- Bob?
- Wade?
- Oh my God, I haven't seen you since, TGIFridays!
- Jacksonville. Fridays.
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is she still
fixing that tuna casserole? It's so good, but bad for...
- Your... on the left... You are beautiful...
- That is so sweet! Thanks!
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.
Fire!
Hey! Climb on.
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.
- You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.
- Wade?
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.
- What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.
- Oh, you never left.
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.
Well I hope they've blocked pain to your
every last nerve. 'Cause I'mma go looking!
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.
When I'm finished, what's left to grow back you?
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.
- Fine. Fists.
- Sounds like your last Saturday night.
Asshole!
- Hang in there, baby. I got you.
- Wade!
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.
Shit, shit, shit!
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.
Dammit! Maximum effort!
Thanks.
Just take it slow.
Oh, my God! That was so awe---
- Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!
- What?
You sure are a fucking idiot.
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?
- What?
- You heard me.
No, no!
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
Any last words?
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!
Wade!
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?
- Four or five moments, that's all it takes.
- To...?
Be a hero.
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero.
Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true.
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.
Moments when you're offered a choice.
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...
... spare an enemy.
In these moments, everything else falls away.
The way the world sees us.
The way we---
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.
I can't even tell you... I deserve that...
that too.. No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.
Start talking!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,
- I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner...
It's been a rough couple of years.
- Rough?
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...
Every night we spoon for warmth, everybody
fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.
So you live in a house?
I should've come
and found you sooner.
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.
You made this mask?
And this one. In case
the other fell off.
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Hey...
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..
It's a face...
I'd be happy to sit on.
But I'm not the same underneath
this suit either. Super-penis.
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.
What are you still doing ---- Get
outta here, go make yourself useful.
You, go be a really big brother to someone.
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.
And you, chicken noodle. Nothing
Compares 2 U. Sinead O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.
- That's all right. You're cool.
- What in the ass?
- That was not mean! I'm proud of you!
- We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.
You know, for a second there, it felt like we were 3 mini
lion robots coming together to form one super robot.
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.
Come here.
WHAM! As promised.
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, here we go...
Looks nice, not gonna be the only thing that's pulling out tonight.
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh? Until next
time, this is your friendly neighborhood Pool guy singing...
You're still here.
It's over! Go home!
Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.
What were you expecting, Sam Jackson'll
show up? Eye patch? Saucy leather? Go, go.
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.
In the sequel, we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time-travel. We have no idea who to cast yet,
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley.
She's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret.
And don't leave your garbage rotting
around. It's a total dick move. Go.
