Good morning, Soldier.
Ready to comply.
I have a mission for you.
Sanction and extract.
No witnesses.
Well done Soldier.
All right, what do you see?
Standard beat cops.
Small station.
Quiet street.
It's a good target.
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?
Cameras.
Both cross streets are one-way.
So, compromised escape routes.
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.
He isn't afraid
to make a mess on the way out.
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.
It's also bulletproof,
which means private security...
which means more guns, which means more
headaches for somebody. Probably us.
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?
Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?
Eyes on target, folks.
This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow
in six months. I don't want to lose him.
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.
He kind of hates us.
Sam...
see that garbage truck?
Tag it.
Give me X-ray.
That truck's loaded for max weight.
And the driver's armed.
It's a battering ram.
- Go now.
- What?
He's not hitting the police.
Body armour, AR-15s.
I make seven hostiles.
I make five.
Sam.
Four.
Rumlow's on the third floor.
Wanda, just like we practised.
What about the gas?
Get it out.
Pack it up.
He's here.
Rumlow has a biological weapon.
I'm on it.
I don't work like that no more.
Fire in the hole.
No!
Sam.
He's in an AFV heading north.
Take this to the airstrip.
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.
Where are you going to meet us?
I'm not.
I've got four, they're splitting up.
I got the two on the left.
They ditched their gear.
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.
There you are, you son of a bitch.
I've been waiting for this.
He doesn't have it.
I'm empty!
Out of the way!
Drop it.
Or I'll drop this.
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
Don't thank me.
I'm not thanking that thing.
His name is Redwing.
I'm still not thanking it.
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
Come on!
This is for dropping
a building on my face.
Ahh!
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.
Who's your buyer?
You know, he knew you.
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
What did you say?
He remembered you.
I was there. He got all weepy about it.
Till they put his brain back in a blender.
He wanted you to know something.
He said to me...
"Please tell Rogers.
"When you gotta go...
"you gotta go."
And you're coming with me.
Oh, my...
Sam...
we need Fire and Rescue
on the south side of the building.
We gotta get up there.
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.
Who's the homeless person on the couch?
This is why
I love coming home for Christmas...
right before you leave town.
Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Really? Which broad? What's her name?
Candice.
Do me a favour?
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.
Okay, so it's Monday.
That is good to know,
I will plan my toga party accordingly.
Where you going?
Your father's flying us
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
We might have to make a quick stop.
At the Pentagon. Right?
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.
I'll get the bags.
He does miss you when you're not here.
And frankly, you're going to miss us.
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.
You know what's about to happen.
Say something.
If you don't, you'll regret it.
I love you, Dad.
And I know you did the best you could.
That's how I wish it happened.
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...
or BARF.
God, I gotta work on that acronym.
An extremely costly method
of hijacking the hippocampus...
to clear traumatic memories.
Huh.
It doesn't change the fact that they
never made it to the airport...
or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?
"To generate, disseminate...
"and preserve knowledge.
"And work with others...
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."
Well, you are the others.
And, quiet as it's kept...
the challenges facing you
are the greatest mankind's ever known.
Plus, most of you are broke.
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.
As of this moment...
every student has been made
an equal recipient...
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.
As in...
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.
No strings, no taxes...
just reframe the future!
Starting now.
Go break some eggs.
Wow. Wow.
That took my breath away.
Oh, Tony! So generous.
So much money! Wow!
Out of curiosity...
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...
Restroom's this way, yeah?
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.
They didn't have time to fix it.
It's fine. I'll be right back.
We'll catch up later.
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.
Ah, they deserve it.
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.
But if you've got the money...
break as many eggs as you like.
Right?
Are you going up?
I'm right where I want to be.
Okay. Hey.
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
I work for the State Department.
Human Resources.
I know it's boring...
but it enabled me to raise a son.
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
His name was Charlie Spencer.
You murdered him.
In Sokovia.
Not that that matters in the least to you.
You think you fight for us?
You just fight for yourself.
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?
He's dead...
and I blame you.
11 Wakandans were among
those killed during a confrontation...
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans
were on an outreach mission...
in Lagos, when the attack occurred.
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...
not only because of
the actions of criminals...
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.
Victory at the expense of the innocent...
is no victory at all.
The Wakandan king went on to...
They are operating outside
and above the international law.
Because that's the reality,
if we don't respond to acts like these.
What legal authority does an enhanced
individual like Wanda Maximoff have...
to operate in Nigeri...?
It's my fault.
That's not true.
Turn the TV back on.
They're being very specific.
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.
Rumlow said "Bucky"...
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,
in Brooklyn.
And people died.
It's on me.
It's on both of us.
This job...
We try to save as many people as we can.
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody.
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...
then next time...
maybe nobody gets saved.
Vis! We talked about this.
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.
Thank you. We'll be right down.
I'll use the door.
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
We know who it is?
The Secretary of State.
Five years ago...
I had a heart attack...
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...
because after 13 hours
of surgery and a triple bypass...
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.
Perspective.
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.
You have fought for us...
protected us, risked your lives...
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...
there are some...
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."
What word would you use, Mr Secretary?
How about "dangerous"?
What would you call a group
of US-based, enhanced individuals...
who routinely ignore sovereign borders...
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned
about what they leave behind?
New York.
Washington, D.C.
Sokovia.
Lagos.
Okay. That's enough.
For the past four years,
you've operated with unlimited power...
and no supervision.
That's an arrangement the governments
of the world can no longer tolerate.
But I think we have a solution.
The Sokovia Accords.
Approved by 117 countries...
it states that the Avengers
shall no longer be a private organisation.
Instead...
they'll operate under the supervision
of a United Nations panel...
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.
I feel we've done that.
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...
you can bet there'd be consequences.
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.
Believe me, this is the middle ground.
So, there are contingencies.
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...
to ratify the Accords.
Talk it over.
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?
Then you retire.
Hello?
Is this your car out front?
I jumped the kerb.
Maybe we could...
take care of it ourselves.
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...
- I guess.
- No.
No cops.
Thank you.
You have kept your looks, Colonel.
Congratulations.
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."
Who are you?
My name is Zemo.
I will repeat my question.
Mission report, December 16, 1991.
How did you find me?
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.
Not easy to decipher.
But, I have experience.
And patience.
A man can do anything if he has those.
What do you want?
Mission report.
December 16.
Go... to... hell!
HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap.
So your death would not bother me.
But I'd have to use this book...
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.
I don't look forward to that.
You'd only be dying for...
your pride.
Hail HYDRA.
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honour...
which is one more than you have.
So let's say we agree to this thing.
How long is it gonna be before they
LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
117 countries want to sign this.
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."
How long are you going to play both sides?
I have an equation.
Oh, this will clear it up.
In the eight years since Mr Stark
announced himself as Iron Man...
the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.
During the same period...
the number of potentially
world-ending events
has risen at a commensurate rate.
Are you saying it's our fault?
I'm saying there may be a causality.
Our very strength invites challenge.
Challenge incites conflict.
And conflict...
breeds catastrophe.
Oversight...
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.
Boom.
Tony.
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.
It's because he's already
made up his mind.
Boy, you know me so well.
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.
It's discomfort.
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.
He's a great kid.
Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA...
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.
Maybe be of service.
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or
Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do.
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.
He decided to spend his summer building
sustainable housing for the poor.
Guess where. Sokovia.
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose.
We won't know because we dropped
a building on him while we were kicking ass.
There's no decision-making process here.
We need to be put in check!
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.
If we can't accept limitations,
if we're boundary-less...
we're no better than the bad guys.
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.
Who said we're giving up?
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.
This document just shifts the blame.
I'm sorry, Steve.
That is dangerously arrogant.
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.
It's not the World Security Council,
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.
No, but it's run by people
with agendas, and agendas change.
That's good. That's why I'm here.
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...
I shut it down and stopped manufacturing.
Tony, you chose to do that.
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?
What if there is somewhere we need
to go and they don't let us?
We may not be perfect,
but the safest hands are still our own.
If we don't do this now,
it's gonna be done to us later.
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
You're saying they'll come for me.
We would protect you.
Maybe Tony's right.
If we have one hand on the wheel,
we can still steer. If we take it off...
Aren't you the same woman who told the
government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
I'm just reading the terrain.
We have made some very public mistakes.
We need to win their trust back.
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...
- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.
No, you can't retract it.
Thank you. Unprecedented.
Okay. Case closed. I win.
I have to go.
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter
to come up and say a few words.
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
She had a photograph in her office.
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.
As a kid, that was pretty cool.
But it was a lot to live up to.
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage...
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.
She said, compromise where you can.
But where you can't, don't.
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."
When I came out of the ice, I thought
everyone I had known was gone.
Then I found out she was alive.
I was just lucky to have her.
She had you back, too.
Who else signed?
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.
Clint?
Says he's retired.
- Wanda?
- TBD.
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.
There's plenty of room on the jet.
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.
What are we giving up to do it?
I'm sorry, Nat.
I can't sign it.
I know.
Then what are you doing here?
I didn't want you to be alone.
Come here.
At a special United Nations conference...
117 countries have come together
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?
- Yes?
- These need your signature.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
You seem to be doing all right so far.
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.
Well, I'm not.
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.
Why? You don't approve of all this?
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.
Unless you need to move a piano.
Ms Romanoff.
King T'Chaka.
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.
Thank you.
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.
Yes, so am I.
If everyone could please be seated.
This assembly is now in session.
That is the future calling.
Such a pleasure.
Thank you.
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,
you're getting quite good at it.
I'm happy, Father.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When stolen Wakandan vibranium
was used to make a terrible weapon...
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.
Those men and women killed in Nigeria...
were part of a goodwill mission
from a country too long in the shadows.
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.
Wakanda is proud
to extend its hand in peace.
Everybody get down!
My mom tried
to talk me out of enlisting...
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.
She bought me my first thigh holster.
Very practical.
And stylish.
CIA has you stationed over here now?
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Right. Right. Sounds fun.
I know, right?
I've been meaning to ask you.
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...
You mean when I was doing my job.
Did Peggy know?
She kept so many secrets.
I didn't want her to have one from you.
Thanks for walking me back.
Sure.
Steve.
There's something you gotta see.
A bomb hidden in a news van...
Who's coordinating?
...ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.
Good. They're solid. Forensics?
More than 70 people have been injured.
At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.
Officials have released
a video of a suspect...
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...
the Winter Soldier.
The infamous HYDRA agent...
linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.
I have to go to work.
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.
We need the whole team here
in two hours or it's not worth it.
I'm very sorry.
In my culture...
death is not the end.
It's more of a stepping-off point.
You reach out with both hands...
and Bast and Sekhmet,
they lead you into the green veldt...
where you can run forever.
That sounds very peaceful.
My father thought so.
I am not my father.
T'Challa...
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.
I'll kill him myself.
Yeah?
You all right?
Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.
Stay home. You'll only make this worse.
For all of us.
Please.
Are you saying you'll arrest me?
No.
Someone will.
If you interfere. That's how it works now.
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.
Why?
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.
Shit.
She tell you to stay out of it?
Might have a point.
He'd do it for me.
1945, maybe.
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.
The people that shoot at you
usually wind up shooting at me.
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.
Most of it's noise.
Except for this.
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.
Thank you.
You're gonna have to hurry.
We have orders to shoot on sight.
Homecoming

Freight car
I have your breakfast.
I could smell it before I opened the door.
Side of bacon and black coffee.
Again.
I can make you something
different, if you like.
This is wonderful...
I will just put this on your...
It's okay, I can manage!
Heads up, Cap.
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.
Understood.
Do you know me?
You're Steve.
I read about you in a museum.
They've set the perimeter.
I know you're nervous,
and you have plenty of reason to be.
But you're lying.
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.
They're entering the building.
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.
That's smart.
Good strategy.
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.
- It always ends in a fight.
- Five seconds.
You pulled me from the river.
Why?
- I don't know.
- Three seconds.
Yes, you do.
Breach! Breach! Breach!
Buck, stop!
You're gonna kill someone.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.
Suspect has broken containment!
...he's headed down the east stairwell!
Come on, man.
Ahhh!
Sam, southwest rooftop.
Who the hell's the other guy?
About to find out.
- Sam.
- Got him.
Stand down!
Stand down!
Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Right behind you.
Stand down, now.
Congratulations, Cap.
You're a criminal.
Your Highness.
"A pinch of paprika."
A pinch.
Is that paprikash?
I thought it might lift your spirits.
Spirits lifted.
In my defence, I haven't actually
ever eaten anything before, so...
May I?
Please.
- Wanda?
- Hmm.
No one dislikes you, Wanda.
Thanks.
Oh, you're welcome.
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.
They can't help but be afraid of you.
Are you?
My amygdala is synthetic, so...
I used to think of myself one way.
But after this...
I am something else.
I'm still me, I think, but...
that's not what everyone else sees.
Do you know, I don't know what this is?
Not really.
I know it's not of this world...
that it powered Loki's staff,
gave you your abilities, but...
its true nature is a mystery.
And yet, it is part of me.
Are you afraid of it?
I wish to understand it.
The more I do, the less it controls me.
One day... who knows?
I may even control it.
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.
I'm gonna go to the store.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
Vision, are you not letting me leave?
It is a question of safety.
I can protect myself.
Not yours.
Mr Stark would like to avoid
the possibility of another public incident.
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.
And what do you want?
For people to see you...
as I do.
So, you like cats?
- Sam.
- What?
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?
Your suit... it's vibranium?
The Black Panther has been the protector
of Wakanda for generations.
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...
I also wear the mantle of king.
So, I ask you...
as both warrior and king...
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?
What's gonna happen to him?
Same thing that ought to happen to you.
Psychological evaluation and extradition.
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.
What about a lawyer?
Lawyer. That's funny.
See their weapons are placed in lockup.
We'll write you a receipt.
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.
You'll be provided
with an office instead of a cell.
Now, do me a favour, stay in it?
I don't intend on going anywhere.
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.
He's alive.
No.
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.
Obviously you can quote me on that,
because I just said it. Anything else?
Thank you, sir.
"Consequences"?
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted.
Had to give him something.
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Technically, it's the
government's property.
Wings, too.
That's cold.
Warmer than jail.
Hey, you wanna see something cool?
I pulled something from Dad's archives.
Felt timely.
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.
I'm trying to... What do you call it?
That's an olive branch.
Is that what you call it?
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
We're kinda...
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?
No. Definitely not.
We're taking a break.
It's nobody's fault.
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...
and then Ultron. My fault.
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.
I don't wanna lose her.
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.
In her defence, I'm a handful.
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and Mom always made it work.
I'm glad Howard got married.
I only knew him
when he was young and single.
Oh, really? You two knew each other?
He never mentioned that.
Maybe only a thousand times.
God, I hated you.
I don't mean to make things difficult.
I know, because you're
a very polite person.
If I see a situation pointed south...
I can't ignore it.
Sometimes I wish I could.
No, you don't.
No, I don't.
Sometimes...
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.
But I don't wanna see you gone.
We need you, Cap.
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.
We can make the last 24 hours legit.
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...
instead of a Wakandan prison.
I'm not saying it's impossible...
but there would have to be safeguards.
Sure.
Once we put out the PR fire,
those documents can be amended.
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...
Wanda? What about Wanda?
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.
Vision's keeping her company.
Oh, God, Tony.
Every time I think you see
things the right way...
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.
It's got a screening room.
There's worse ways to protect people.
Protection?
Is that how you see this?
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.
She's a kid!
Give me a break!
I'm doing what has to be done.
To stave off something worse.
You keep telling yourself that.
Hate to break up the set.
Hello, Mr Barnes.
I've been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.
Do you mind if I sit?
Your first name is James?
The receipt for your gear.
"Bird costume"? Come on.
I didn't write it.
I'm not here to judge you.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
Do you know where you are, James?
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.
My name is Bucky.
Hello?
Hey!
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?
Steve, we looked for the guy
for two years and found nothing.
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee
that whoever framed him would get him.
It guarantees that we would.
Yeah.
Tell me, Bucky.
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You fear that if you open your mouth,
the horrors might never stop.
Don't worry.
We only have to talk about one.
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.
Friday, get me a source on that outage.
Sub-level five, East Wing.
What the hell is this?
Why don't we discuss your home?
Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no.
I mean your real home.
Longing
No.
Rusted
Stop.
Seventeen
Stop.
Daybreak
Furnace
Nine
Benign
Homecoming
One
Freight car
Soldier?
Ready to comply.
Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Help me.
Help.
Get up.
Who are you? What do you want?
To see an empire fall.
Hey.
Evac all civilians.
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.
Please tell me you brought a suit.
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Follow me.
We're in position.
You could at least recognise me.
Damn it.
He asked me again
if you were going to be there.
I said I wasn't sure.
You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing...
...escaped custody today.
...also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers...
and Sam Wilson.
Hey, Cap!
Steve.
Which Bucky am I talking to?
Your mom's name was Sarah.
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Can't read that in a museum.
Just like that, we're supposed to be cool?
What did I do?
Enough.
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.
- Who was he?
- I don't know.
People are dead. The bombing, the setup...
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.
I need you to do
better than "I don't know."
He wanted to know about Siberia.
Where I was kept.
He wanted to know exactly where.
Why would he need to know that?
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
It hurts!
Good work.
Get me out of here.
Who were they?
Their most elite death squad.
More kills than anyone in HYDRA history.
And that was before the serum.
They all turn out like you?
Worse.
The doctor, could he control them?
Enough.
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
With these guys, he could do it.
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise.
They can take a whole country down
in one night, you'd never see them coming.
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.
Even if he did...
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.
We're on our own.
Maybe not.
I know a guy.
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?
We will.
GSG 9's got the borders covered.
Recon's flying 24/7.
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.
It's clear you can't be objective.
I'm putting Special Ops on this.
What happens when the shooting starts?
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
If we're provoked.
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.
There are dead people
who would be alive now.
Feel free to check my math.
All due respect, you're not gonna
solve this with boys and bullets, Ross.
You gotta let us bring them in.
How would that end
any differently than last time?
Because this time, I won't be
wearing loafers and a silk shirt.
72 hours, guaranteed.
36 hours.
Barnes.
Rogers.
Wilson.
Thank you, sir.
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?
You all right?
Always.
36 hours. Jeez.
We're seriously understaffed.
Oh, yeah.
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
You really think he'd be on our side?
No.
I have an idea.
Me, too. Where's yours?
Downstairs.
Where's yours?
Hey, May.
Mmm. Hey.
How was school today?
It was okay.
This crazy car parked outside.
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...
What are you doing...
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.
Tony.
What are you doing here?
It's about time we met.
You've been getting my emails, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?
Regarding the...
You didn't even tell me about the grant.
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Remember when you applied?
Yeah.
I approved, so now we're in business.
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?
You keeping secrets from me now?
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...
Anyway, what did I apply for?
That's what I'm here to hash out.
Okay. Hash it out, okay.
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.
Yeah? Wow.
Look who you're talking to.
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.
Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh?
Thrift store? Salvation Army?
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?
Yeah, I was...
Anyway, look, um, I definitely
did not apply for your grant...
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.
That's you, right?
Um, no.
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.
Look at you go.
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.
That's not easy. You got mad skills.
That's all on YouTube, though, right?
That's where you found that?
Because you know that's all fake.
It's all done on the computer.
Mmm-hmm.
It's like that video. What is it?
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?
Exactly.
Oh, what have we here?
Uh...
You're the Spider-ling.
Crime-fighting spider. You're Spider-Boy?
Spider-Man.
Not in that onesie, you're not.
It's not a onesie.
I don't believe this. I was actually
having a really good day today, Mr Stark.
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...
and Algebra test, nailed it.
Who else knows? Anybody?
Nobody.
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?
No. No.
No! If she knew, she would freak out.
And when she freaks out, I freak out.
You know what I think is really cool?
This webbing.
That tensile strength is off the charts.
Who manufactured that?
I did.
Climbing walls, how you doing that?
Adhesive gloves?
It's a long story. I was...
Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Yes, I can.
I'm blind!
I can see in those.
Okay?
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.
You're in dire need of an upgrade.
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.
That's why I'm here.
Why you doing this?
I gotta know, what's your MO?
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?
Because...
Because I've been me my whole life,
and I've had these powers for six months.
Mmm-hmm.
I read books, I build computers.
Yeah, I would love to play football,
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.
Sure, because you're different.
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...
and then the bad things happen...
they happen because of you.
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.
That's what it is.
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.
You got a passport?
No, I don't even have a driver's licence.
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.
Oh, you'll love it.
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?
I got homework.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.
Might be a little dangerous.
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.
Don't tell Aunt May.
All right, Spider-Man.
Get me out of this.
Sorry. I'll get the...
What is it?
Stay here, please.
Guess I shoulda knocked.
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?
Disappointing my kids.
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.
Cap needs our help. Come on.
Clint!
You should not be here.
Really?
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.
Okay, they're considered.
Okay, we gotta go.
It's this way.
I've caused enough problems.
You gotta help me, Wanda.
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.
Shit.
I knew I should've stretched.
Clint, you can't overpower me.
I know I can't.
But she can.
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.
I'm leaving.
I can't let you.
I'm sorry.
If you do this...
they will never stop being afraid of you.
I can't control their fear, only my own.
Oh...
Come on. We got one more stop.
It's just a matter of time.
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,
and behavioural pattern scans.
Move or you will be moved.
As entertaining as that would be...
You really think you can find him?
My resources are considerable.
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.
You know where they are.
I know someone who does.
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.
It's low profile.
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.
Can you move your seat up?
No.
I owe you again.
Keeping a list.
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.
They're going to come looking for you.
I know.
Thank you, Sharon.
That was...
Late.
Damn right.
I should go.
Okay.
Cap.
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.
Besides, I owe a debt.
Thanks for having my back.
It was time to get off my ass.
How about our other recruit?
He's rarin' to go.
Had to put a little coffee in him...
but he should be good.
What time zone is this?
Come on. Come on.
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.
It's an honour.
I'm shaking your hand too long.
Wow! This is awesome!
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!
Jeez.
Ah, look, I wanna say, I know
you know a lot of super people, so...
thinks for thanking of me.
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?
Uh, good to see you.
Look, what happened last time when I...
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.
They tell you what we're up against?
Something about some psycho-assassins?
We're outside the law on this one.
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.
Yeah, well, what else is new?
We should get moving.
We got a chopper lined up.
They're evacuating the airport.
Stark.
Stark?
Suit up.
Wow, it's so weird how you run
into people at the airport.
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Definitely weird.
Hear me out, Tony.
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.
Captain.
Your Highness.
Anyway...
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?
You're after the wrong guy.
Your judgement is askew.
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.
Steve...
you know what's about to happen.
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?
All right, I've run out of patience.
Underoos!
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.
It's perfect. Thank you.
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.
Okay. Cap. Captain.
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.
You've been busy.
And you've been a complete idiot.
Dragging in Clint...
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place she doesn't
even want to leave, a safe place.
I'm trying to keep...
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.
You did that when you signed.
All right, we're done.
You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna
come with us, now, because it's us...
or a squad of J-SOC guys...
with no compunction about being impolite.
Come on.
We found it.
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.
All right, Lang.
Hey, guys, something...
Whoa. What the hell was that?
I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Oh, great.
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.
Barnes is mine.
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?
What we discussed.
Keep your distance, web them up.
Okay, copy that.
Move, Captain.
I won't ask a second time.
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
I wouldn't stress about it.
What the hell is that?
Everyone's got a gimmick now.
You have a metal arm?
That is awesome, dude.
You have the right to remain silent!
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...
but it ain't gonna tickle either.
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
You locked me in my room.
Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.
Second, I did it to protect you.
- Hey, Clint.
- Hey, man.
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.
You got tired of shooting golf?
Well, I played 18, shot 18.
Just can't seem to miss.
First time for everything.
Made you look.
Multiple contusions detected.
Yeah, I detected that, too.
Oh, God!
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!
Ahh!
Those wings carbon fibre?
Is this stuff coming out of you?
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...
but there's usually not this much talking.
All right, sorry. My bad.
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,
but I've only got one job here today...
and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.
You couldn't have done that earlier?
I hate you.
Great.
Hey, Cap, heads-up!
Throw it at this.
Now!
Oh, come on!
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.
Uh, sorry.
All right, now I'm pissed.
Is this part of the plan?
Well, my plan was go easy on them.
You wanna switch it up?
There's our ride.
Come on!
Captain Rogers...
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.
But for the collective good...
you must surrender now.
What do we do, Cap?
We fight.
This is gonna end well.
They're not stopping.
Neither are we.
We're still friends, right?
Depends on how hard you hit me.
You were pulling your punches.
I didn't kill your father.
Then why did you run?
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.
He also said to go for your legs.
Ahh!
Clint, can you get him off me?
Buckled in?
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!
Stark tell you anything else?
That you're wrong. You think you're right.
That makes you dangerous.
Guess he had a point.
You got heart, kid. Where you from?
Queens.
Brooklyn.
Friday?
We have some weapon systems offline.
What?
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.
Who's speaking?
It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.
Friday?
Deploying fire suppression system.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy!
Whoa!
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
We gotta draw out the flyers.
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.
No, you get to the jet!
Both of you!
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
As much as I hate to admit it...
if we're gonna win this one,
some of us might have to lose it.
This isn't the real fight, Steve.
All right, Sam. What's the play?
We need a diversion. Something big.
I got something kinda big.
But I can't hold it very long.
On my signal, run like hell.
And if I tear myself in half...
don't come back for me.
He's gonna tear himself in half?
You sure about this, Scott?
I do it all the time.
I mean, once. In a lab.
Then I passed out.
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.
Holy shit!
Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
I guess that's the signal.
Way to go, Tic Tac!
Give me back my Rhodey.
I got him.
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...
I'm open to suggestions.
You wanna get to them...
you gotta go through me.
Uh-huh.
We haven't met yet.
- I'm Clint.
- I don't care.
Whoa!
Ahhh!
Get off!
Something just flew in me!
You're not gonna stop.
You know I can't.
I'm gonna regret this.
Go.
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,
Empire Strikes Back?
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.
He's on the young side.
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet...
with the walking thingies?
Maybe the kid's onto something.
High now, Tony. Go high.
Yes!
That was awesome!
Does anyone have any orange slices?
Kid, you all right?
Whoa!
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.
- That was scary.
- Yeah.
You're done, all right?
What? I'm good, I'm fine.
You did a good job. Stay down.
No, it's good. I gotta get him back.
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!
- Dude.
- You're done!
Wait.
Mr Stark, wait. I'm not done. I'm not...
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
I said I'd help you find him,
not catch him.
There's a difference.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
It's as I said.
Catastrophe.
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.
Vision! You copy?
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.
Rhodey!
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.
Rhodes!
Read vitals.
Heartbeat detected.
Emergency medical is on its way.
I'm sorry.
- this is room 201...
Bacon and black coffee again today?
You know me so well...
Hello? Your breakfast is here.
May I let myself in?
What's gonna happen to your friends?
Whatever it is...
I'll deal with it.
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
What you did all those years...
It wasn't you.
You didn't have a choice.
I know.
But I did it.
How did this happen?
I became distracted.
I didn't think that was possible.
Neither did I.
The doctors say he shattered
L4 through S1.
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.
Steve's not gonna stop.
If you don't either, Rhodey's
gonna be the best case scenario.
You let them go, Nat.
We played this wrong.
"We"?
Boy, it must be hard to shake
the whole double agent thing, huh?
It sticks in the DNA.
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...
for one goddamn second?
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...
they're coming for you.
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.
What am I looking at, Friday?
Priority upload from Berlin police.
Fire up the chopper.
The Task Force called for a psychiatrist
as soon as Barnes was captured.
The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard
from Geneva within the hour.
He was met by this man.
Did you run facial recognition yet?
What do I look like?
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.
You must be thinking of someone else.
Must be.
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.
Sokovian Intelligence.
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...
a Sokovian covert kill squad.
What happened to the real Broussard?
He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room.
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Son of a bitch.
- Get this to Ross.
- Yes, boss.
This is Raft Prison Control.
You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.
So? You got the files?
Let's reroute the satellites,
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
You seriously think I'm gonna listen
to you after that fiasco in Leipzig?
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.
The Futurist, gentlemen!
The Futurist is here!
He sees all!
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.
Give me a break, Barton.
I had no idea
they'd put you here. Come on.
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...
Criminals?
Criminals, Tony.
Think that's the word you're looking for.
Right?
That didn't used to mean me.
Or Sam, or Wanda.
But here we are.
- Because you broke the law.
- Yeah.
I didn't make you.
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.
I don't understand, why didn't you
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?
You gotta watch your back with this guy.
There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.
Who are you?
Come on, man.
How's Rhodes?
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...
so fingers crossed.
What do you need? They feed you yet?
You're the good cop, now?
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.
Well, you better go get a bad cop...
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...
to get information out of me.
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.
What'd you do?
Get it back up!
Just look.
Because that...
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.
That's a first.
Cap is definitely off the reservation...
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to...
Hey, it's all right.
Look, I'll tell you...
but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Easy.
Stark?
Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Nope. Told me to go to hell.
I'm going back to the compound instead,
but you can call me anytime.
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.
You remember that time we had to ride back
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?
Was that the time we used our train money
to buy hot dogs?
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.
What was her name, again?
Dolores. You called her Dot.
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.
So are we, pal.
He can't have been here
more than a few hours.
Long enough to wake them up.
You ready?
Yeah.
You seem a little defensive.
It's been a long day.
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.
Then why are you here?
Could be your story's not so crazy.
Maybe.
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.
It's good to see you, Tony.
You too, Cap.
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.
There's a truce here. You can drop...
I got heat signatures.
How many?
Uh, one.
If it's any comfort,
they died in their sleep.
Did you really think I wanted more of you?
What the hell?
I'm grateful to them, though.
They brought you here.
Please, Captain.
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
I'm betting I could beat that.
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.
Given time.
But then you'd never know why you came.
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.
I studied you.
I followed you.
But now that you're standing here...
I just realised...
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.
How nice to find a flaw.
You're Sokovian.
Is that what this is about?
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.
No.
I'm here because I made a promise.
You lost someone?
I lost everyone.
And so will you.
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.
But one which crumbles from within?
That's dead.
Forever.
I know that road.
What is this?
Help my wife.
Please. Help.
Sergeant Barnes?
Howard!
Howard!
No, Tony.
Did you know?
I didn't know it was him.
Don't bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know?
Yes.
Get out of here!
It wasn't him, Tony.
HYDRA had control of his mind!
Move!
It wasn't him!
Left bootjet failing.
Flight systems compromised.
Ah, crap.
He's not gonna stop. Go.
Come on, come on.
Targeting system's knackered, boss.
I'm eyeballing it.
Do you even remember them?
I remember all of them.
This isn't gonna change what happened.
I don't care.
He killed my mom.
You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
I almost killed the wrong man.
Hardly an innocent one.
This is all you wanted?
To see them rip each other apart.
My father lived outside the city.
I thought we would be safe there.
My son was excited.
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.
I told my wife, "Don't worry.
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."
When the dust cleared...
and the screaming stopped...
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.
My father...
still holding my wife and son in his arms.
And the Avengers?
They went home.
I knew I couldn't kill them.
More powerful men than me have tried.
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...
I'm sorry about your father.
He seemed a good man.
With a dutiful son.
Vengeance has consumed you.
It's consuming them.
I am done letting it consume me.
Justice will come soon enough.
Tell that to the dead.
The living are not done with you, yet.
You can't beat him hand-to-hand.
Analyse his fight pattern.
Scanning.
Countermeasures ready.
Let's kick his ass.
He's my friend.
So was I.
Stay down. Final warning.
I could do this all day.
That shield doesn't belong to you.
You don't deserve it.
My father made that shield!
Meals at 8 and 5.
Toilet privileges twice a day.
Raise your voice, zap.
Touch the glass, zap.
You step out of line, you deal with me.
Please, step out of line, hmm?
So how does it feel?
To spend all that time, all that effort...
to see it fail so spectacularly?
Did it?
- It's just the first pass.
- Yeah.
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.
Shock absorption, lateral movement.
Cup holder?
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...
Ow.
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
No. Don't help me.
Ah.
138 combat missions.
That's how many I've flown, Tony.
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.
Because the fight needed to be fought.
It's the same with these Accords.
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...
This is a bad beat.
But it hasn't changed my mind.
I don't think.
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.
Are you Tony Stank?
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.
Thank you for that!
Never dropping that, by the way.
"Table for one, Mr Stank.
"Please, by the bathroom."
Tony...
I'm glad you're back at the compound.
I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.
We all need family.
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.
I've been on my own since I was 18.
I never really fit in anywhere,
even in the Army.
My faith's in people, I guess.
Individuals.
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...
they haven't let me down.
Which is why I can't let them down either.
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.
I know I hurt you, Tony.
I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...
I was sparing you...
but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.
And I'm sorry.
Hopefully one day you can understand.
I wish we agreed on the Accords.
I really do.
I know you're doing what you believe in,
and that's all any of us can do.
That's all any of us should.
Priority call from Secretary Ross.
There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Yeah, put him through.
Tony, we have a problem.
- Uh, please hold.
- No, don't.
So no matter what...
I promise you...
if you need us...
if you need me...
I'll be there.
You sure about this?
I can't trust my own mind.
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...
I think going back under
is the best thing.
For everybody.
Thank you for this.
Your friend and my father...
they were both victims.
If I can help one of them find peace...
You know, if they find out he's here...
they'll come for him.
Let them try.
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
I tackle, we tussle
Oh, my days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt Single Action Army
Oh, no
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz
Girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh, my days
He disagrees
Oh, no
Speak easy

Oh, no
Who was it? Who hit you?
Some guy.
So itchy, man, God.
What's "some guy's" name?
Uh, Steve.
Steve? From 12-C?
- With the overbite?
- No, no, no.
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.
Ouch.
Well...
I hope you got a few good licks in.
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.
His friend was huge. Like huge.
That's way better. Thank you.
Okay, tough guy.
Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?


A long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away....
- Mama.
- We know.
Jyn, gather your things, it's time.
Hello.
Saw, it's Lyra.
It's happened.
He's come for us.
You know what to do.
Jyn, come here.
Remember, whatever I do,
I do it to protect you.
Say you understand.
I understand.
- I love you, Stardust.
- I love you too, Papa.
Galen.
Go.
Jyn.
You know where to go, don't you?
Trust the force.
You're a hard man to find, Galen.
But farming?
Really, a man of your talents?
It's a peaceful life.
It's lonely, I imagine.
Since Lyra died, yes.
Oh.
Oh.
My condolences.
Search the house!
Understood.
What is it you want?
The work has stalled,
I need you to come back.
I won't do it, Krennic.
We're on the verge of greatness.
We were this close
to providing peace,
security for the galaxy.
You're confusing peace with terror.
Do I, huh?
You have to start somewhere.
I'll be of no help, Krennic.
My mind just isn't
what it was.
I have trouble remembering,
even simple things.
Galen,
you're an inspired scientist
but you're a terrible liar.
Now I admire the effort,
I really do.
Oh look, here's Lyra back from the dead.
It's a miracle.
Stop!
Oh, Lyra.
Troublesome as ever.
You're not taking him.
No, of course I'm not.
I'm taking you all.
You'll all come.
You, your child,
- You'll all live in comfort.
- As hostages.
As 'heroes of the Empire.'
Lyra.
Put it down.
Think very carefully.
- You will never win.
- Do it.
Lyra!
No!
They have a child.
Find it!
My child.
Come.
Come.
We have a long ride
ahead of us.
ROGUE ONE
Check in, security.
Cell block 4227
- I was about to leave.
- I came as fast as I could.
I have to get back on board.
- Walk with me.
- Back to Jedha?
They'll leave without me!
Easy. You have news from Jedha?
Come on.
An Imperial pilot, one of the cargo drivers.
He defected yesterday.
He's telling people
they're making a weapon.
The kyber crystals,
that's what they're for.
What kind of weapon?
- Look, I have to go.
- What kind of weapon?
A planet killer.
That's what he called it.
A planet killer?
Someone named Erso sent him.
- Some old friend of Saw's.
- Galen Erso?
- Was it?
- I don't know! They were looking for Saw when we left.
- Who else knows this?
- I have no idea!
It's all falling apart.
Saw's right, there're spies everywhere
What's all this?
Come on, let's see some scandocs.
Yeah, of course.
My gloves?
No
What've you done?
Troopers down, section 9.
Are you crazy?
I'll never climb out of here.
My arm...
Get out of the way.
Move! Move!
Calm down.
Calm down.
We'll be all right.
Is that him?
He looks kind of different
than I imagined.
Okay,
so you're-you're Saw Gerrera?
Saw Gerrera.
No?
Okay, we're just wasting
time that we don't have.
I need to speak to Saw Gerrera!
I keep telling them before, before it's too late.
We're out here in the middle of nowhere.
We need to get to Jedha City.
What part of urgent message
do you guys not understand?
Hey!
we're all on the same side, if you just
see past the uniform for a minute
I've got to speak to ah...
I've got to speak to Saw Gerrera.
What now?
I don't know.
Must be another pick up.
I thought we had everybody.
-All clear, sir.
- Hallik!
- Liana Hallik!
- Her.
You want to get out of here?
Hey!
What about me?
Congratulations.
You are being rescued
Please do not resist.
LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.
You're currently calling yourself Liana Hallik.
Is that correct?
Possession of unsanctioned weapons,
forgery of Imperial documents,
aggravated assault,
escape from custody, resisting arrest
Imagine if the Imperial authorities had
found out who you really were. Jyn Erso?
That's your given name, is it not?
Jyn Erso?
Daughter of Galen Erso.
A known Imperial collaborator
in weapons development.
What is this?
It's a chance for you
to make a fresh start.
We think you might be
able to help us.
This is Captain Cassian Andor,
Rebel Intelligence.
When was the last time you were
in contact with your father?
15 years ago.
Any idea where he's been
all that time?
I like to think he's dead,
makes things easier.
Easier than what? That he's being a tool
of the Imperial war machine?
- I've never had the luxury of political opinions.
- Really?
When was your last contact
with Saw Gerrera?
It's been a long time.
He'd remember you, though,
wouldn't he?
He might agree to meet you,
if you came as a friend.
We're up against the clock here, girl,
So if there's nothing to talk about,
we'll just put you back
where we found you.
I was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life.
He raised me. But I've no idea where he is.
I haven't seen him in years.
We know how to find him,
that's not our problem.
What we need is someone who gets us
through the door without being killed.
You're all rebels, aren't you?
Yes, but Saw Gerrera's an extremist.
He's been fighting on his own
since he broke with the Rebellion.
His militancy has caused the Alliance
a great many problems.
We have no choice now but to try
to mend that broken trust.
What does this have
to do with my father?
There's an Imperial defector in Jedha.
A pilot.
He's being held by Saw Gerrera.
He's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon
with the power to destroy entire planets.
The pilot says he was
sent by your father.
We need to stop this
weapon before it is finished.
Captain Andor's mission is to authenticate
the pilot's story and then, if possible, find your father.
It appears he is critical to the
development of this superweapon.
Given the gravity of the situation
and your history with Saw,
we're hoping that he will help us locate your father
and return him to the Senate for testimony.
And if I do it?
We'll make sure you go free.
Captain Andor!
I'm Kay-Tuesso (K-2SO)
I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.
I remember you.
I see the Council is sending you
with us to Jedha.
Apparently so.
That is a bad idea.
I think so, and so does Cassian.
What do I know?
My specialty is just strategic analysis.
Galen Erso is vital to the
Empire's weapon program.
Forget what you heard in there,
there will be no extraction.
You find him,
you kill him.
Then and there.
You met Kay-Tu?
Charming.
He tends to say whatever
comes into his circuits.
It's a by-product of the reprogram.
Why does she get a blaster,
and I don't?
- What.
- I know how to use it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Give it to me.
We're going to Jedha.
That's a war zone.
That's not the point.
- Where did you get it?
- I found it.
I find that answer
vague and unconvincing.
Trust goes both ways.
You're letting her keep it?
Would you like to know the probability
of her using it against you?
- It's high.
- Let's get going.
It's very high.
Lies!
Deceptions!
Let's see it.
Bodhi Rook.
Cargo pilot.
- Local boy, huh?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, I can hear you.
He didn't capture me,
I came here myself.
I defected, I defected.
Every day, more lies.
Lies?
Would I risk everything for a lie?
No, we don't have time for this!
I have to speak to Saw Gerrera
before it's too late.
Okay...
So, you...
Um.
Uh.
That's-That's for you.
And I gave it to them,
they did not find it!
I gave it to them.
Galen Erso.
He told me to find you.
Bor Gullet.
Bor Gullet?
Galen Erso sent me!
He told me to find you!
Most unfortunate about the security breach
on Jedha, Director Krennic.
After so many setbacks and delays,
and now this.
We've heard word of rumors
circulating through the city.
Apparently you've lost
a rather talkative cargo pilot.
If the Senate gets wind of our project,
countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.
When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin,
the Senate will be of little concern.
When has become now, Director Krennic.
The Emperor will tolerate no further delay,
you have made time
an ally of the Rebellion.
I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously
with an immediate test of the weapon.
Failure will find you explaining why
to a far less patient audience.
I will not fail.
What's the matter, Jyn?
You looked frightened.
I'll always protect you.
Stardust.
Don't ever change.
Trust...
Galen.
We're coming into orbit.
You have controls.
That's Jedha.
Or what's left of it.
We find Saw,
we find your father.
What's with the Destroyer?
It's because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera.
He's been attacking the cargo shipments.
What are they bringing in?
It's 'what are they taking out?'
Kyber crystal.
All they can get.
We wondered why they were
stripping the temple, now we know.
It's the fuel for the weapon.
The weapon your father's building.
Maybe we should leave
target practice behind.
Are you talking about me?
She's right.
We need to blend in.
Stay with the ship.
I can blend in.
I'm an Imperial droid.
This city is under Imperial occupation
Half the people here want to reprogram you.
The other half want to put a hole in your head.
I'm surprised you're so concerned
with my safety.
I'm not. I'm just worried
they might miss you and hit me.
Doesn't sound so bad to me.
Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts,
No lie is safe.
What have you really
brought me, cargo pilot?
Bor Gullet will know the truth.
The unfortunate side effect,
- is that one tends to lose one's mind.
- No.
Hey, you just watch yourself.
No, no.
Tourist, we don't want any trouble, sorry.
Come on.
Come on.
Citizens of Jedha,
you must come forward with information
of the location of this missing cargo pilot.
A reward of 600 credits for the
information shall be awarded.
I had a contact,
one of Saw's rebels,
but he's just gone missing.
His sister will be looking for him.
The temple's been destroyed
but she'll be there waiting.
We'll give her your name and hope
that gets us a meeting with Saw.
Hope?
Yeah.
Rebellions are built on hope.
Hands where I can see them.
Get over there.
Show me some identification.
Check inside.
Is this all because of your pilot?
May the Force of others be with you.
- May the Force of others be with you.
- Wait for me.
May the Force of others be with you.
May the Force of others be with you.
Would you trade that necklace
for a glimpse into your future?
Yes, I'm speaking to you.
I am Chirrut mwe.
How did you know
I was wearing a necklace?
For that answer you must pay.
What do you know of kyber crystals?
My father, he said they powered
the Jedi lightsabers.
Jyn.
Come on, let's go.
The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.
Let's go.
We're not here to make friends.
Who are they?
The Guardians of the Whills.
Protectors of the Kyber Temple.
But there's nothing left to protect, so
now they're just causing trouble for everybody.
You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.
We have to hurry.
This townit's ready to blow.
Citizens of the Empire,
Imperial forces...
Tell me you have a backup plan.
Incoming.
Put your guns down.
Behind us.
Looks like we found Saw's rebels.
Jyn, no!
Thank you.
Hit the tower.
Get out of there!
Quickly, the kyber, get it.
Here, take the kyber.
Take the kyber.
Come on!
This way!
Did you know that wasn't me?
Of course!
I thought I told
you to stay on the ship
You did, but I thought it was boring,
and you were in trouble.
There are a lot of explosions
for two people blending in.
Freeze right there...
You're right,
I should just wait on the ship.
Halt!
Stop right there!
Where are you taking these prisoners?
- These are prisoners.
- Yes. Where are you taking them?
I am taking them... to imprison them.
In prison.
- He's taking us to...
- Quiet!
And there's a fresh one
if you mouth off again!
- We'll take them from here.
- That's okay.
If you could just point me in the right direction,
I can take them, I'm sure.
- I've taken them this far
- Hey, wait a second.
- Take them away.
- Wait!
- Hey, droid.
You can't take them away!
You stay here.
We need to check your diagnostics.
Diagnostics?
I'm capable of running my own diagnostics,
thank you very much.
Let them pass in peace!
Let them pass in peace.
The Force is with me,
and I am with the Force.
And I fear nothing,
for all is as the Force wills it.
Hey!
Stop right there!
He's blind.
Is he deaf?
I said: Stop right there!
Is your foot all right?
You almost shot me.
You're welcome.
Clear of hostiles!
- One hostile!
- He's with us!
They're all right.
Thanks.
Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap.
Go back to the ship.
Wait for my call.
Is he a Jedi?
There are no Jedi here anymore.
Only dreamers like this fool.
The Force did protect me.
I protected you.
Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?
Can't you see
we are no friends of the Empire?
Anyone who kills me or my friends
will answer to Saw Gerrera,
Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso.
Are you kidding me?
I'm blind!
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.
You pray?
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.
Really?
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.
He's praying for the door to open.
It bothers him,
because he knows it is possible.
Baze Malbus was once
the most devoted Guardian of us all.
I'm beginning to think the Force
and I have different priorities.
Relax, Captain.
We've been in worse cages than this one.
This is a first for me.
There is more than
one sort of prison, Captain,
I sense that you carry yours
wherever you go.
Jyn.
Is it really you?
I can't believe it.
Must be quite a surprise.
Are we not still friends?
The last time I saw you, you gave me
a knife and loaded blaster
and told me to wait
in a bunker until daylight.
I knew you were safe.
You left me behind.
You were already
the best soldier in my cadre.
- I was sixteen.
- I was protecting you!
You dumped me!
You were the daughter
of an Imperial science officer!
People were starting to figure that out.
People who wanted to-
to use you as a hostage.
Not a day goes by
that I don't think of you
But today, of all days?
It's a trap, isn't it?
What?
The pilot!
The message.
All of it.
Did they...
send you?
Did you come here to kill me?
There's not much of me left.
The Alliance wants my father.
They think he's sent you
a message about a weapon.
I guess they think by sending me
you might actually help them out.
So what is it that you want, Jyn?
They wanted an introduction,
they've got it.
I'm out now.
The rest of you can do what you want.
You care not about the cause?
The cause?
Seriously?
The Alliance?
The...
The rebels? Whatever it is
you're calling yourself these days?
All it's ever brought me is pain.
You can stand to see the Imperial flag
reign across the galaxy?
It's not a problem
if you don't look up.
I have something to show you,
come.
The Emperor is awaiting my report.
One had hoped that he and Lord Vader
might have been here for such an occasion.
And I thought it prudent to save
you from any potential embarrassment.
Your concern is hardly warranted.
If saying it would only make it so.
All Imperial forces, have been evacuated,
and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.
That won't be necessary.
We need a statement, not a manifesto.
The Holy City will be
enough for the day.
Target Jedha City,
prepare single reactor ignition.
- Sir, we're in position, ready to...
- Fire!
Commence primary ignition.
Who's the one in the next cell?
What?
Where?
An Imperial pilot.
- Pilot?
- I'm going to kill Kim!
- No, no, No, wait!
- Come here!
NO!
Back off.
Back off.
Okay.
Are you the pilot?
Hey, heyare you the pilot?
The shuttle pilot?
Pilot?
What's wrong with him?
Galen Erso.
You know that name?
I brought the message, I'm the pilot.
I'm the pilot.
I'm the pilot.
Okay, good.
Now where is Galen Erso?
Standby.
This is the message I was sent.
Saw, if you're watching this,
then perhaps there is a chance
to save the Alliance.
Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and,
though I don't dare hope for too much,
a chance for Jyn,
if she's alive,
if you can possibly find her
to let her know that
my love for her has never faded
and how desperately I've missed her.
Jyn, my Stardust,
I can't imagine
what you think of me.
When I was taken,
I faced some bitter truths.
I was told that, soon enough,
Krennic would have you as well.
As time went by,
I knew that you were either dead
or so well hidden that
he would never find you.
I knew if I refused to work,
if I took my own life,
it would only be a matter of time
before Krennic realized he no longer
needed me to complete the project.
So I did the one thing
that nobody expected: I lied.
I learned to lie.
I played the part of a beaten man
resigned to the sanctuary of his work.
I made myself indispensable,
and all the while
I laid the groundwork of my revenge.
We call it the Death Star.
There is no better name.
And the day is coming soon
when it will be unleashed.
I've placed a weakness deep within the system.
A flaw so small and powerful,
they'll never find it.
But, Jyn.
Jyn, if you're listening
My beloved, so much of my life
has been wasted.
I try to think of you
only in the moments when I'm strong,
because the pain of not
having you with me
Your mother.
Our family.
The pain of that loss is so overwhelming
I risk failing even now.
It's just so hard
not to think of you.
Think of where you are.
My Stardust.
Saw, the reactor module,
that's the key.
That's the place I've laid my trap.
It's well hidden and unstable,
one blast to any part of it
will destroy the entire station.
You'll need the plans,
the structural plans for the Death Star
to find the reactor.
I know there's a complete
engineering archive in the data vault
at the Citadel Tower on Scarif.
Any pressurized explosion
to the reactor module will set off
a chain reaction that will
destroy the entire station...
Go.
Go.
K-2?
K-2, where are you?
There you are.
I'm standing by as you requested.
Although there's a problem on the horizon.
There is no horizon.
Locate our position.
Bring that ship in here now!
Where are you going?
I've got to find Jyn.
- Get the pilot. We need him.
- All right.
I'll get the pilot.
Pilot.
No, no, no.
Let's go.
Jyn!
We've got to go.
I know where your father is.
Go with him, Jyn.
You must go.
- Come with us.
- I will run no longer.
- Come on.
- But you must save yourself.
- Come on.
- Go!
There's no time!
Save the Rebellion!
Save the dream!
Oh.
It's beautiful.
Chirrut, let's go!
Come on!
Let's get out of here!
Get us out of here!
Punch it!
- I'm not very optimistic about our role.
- Let's not, K
Come on!
- Punch it.
- I haven't completed my calculation.
I'll make them for you.
I believe I owe you
an apology, Director Krennic.
Your work exceeds all expectations.
And you'll tell the Emperor as much?
I will tell him his patience with your
misadventures has been rewarded
with a weapon that will bring
a swift end to the Rebellion.
That was only an inkling
of it's destructive potential
I will tell him, that I will be
taking control over the weapon
I first spoke of years ago
effective immediately.
We stand here amid
my achievementnot yours!
I'm afraid these recent security breaches have
laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.
The breaches have been filled,
Jedha has been silenced.
You think this pilot acted alone?
He was dispatched from
the installation on Eadu.
Galen Erso's facility.
We'll see about this.
A coded message from Captain Andor, sir.
Weapon confirmed.
Jedha destroyed.
Mission target located on Eadu.
Please advise.
Destroyed?
Proceed.
Tell him my orders still stand.
Tell him to proceed with haste
and keep to the plan.
We have no idea what he is
building for the Empire.
We have to kill Galen Erso
while we have the chance.
Baze, tell me.
All of it?
The whole city?
- Tell me.
- All of it.
Understood.
Set a course for Eadu.
Setting course for Eadu.
Is that where my father is?
I think so.
So you're Galen's daughter.
You know him?
I'm Bodhi, the pilot.
You brought the message.
Yes, your father...
He said I could get right by myself.
He said I could make it right,
if I was brave enough
and listened to what
was in my heart.
Do something about it.
Guess it was too late.
It wasn't too late.
Seems pretty late to me.
No.
We can beat the people
who did this.
My father's message, I've seen it.
They call it the Death Star.
But they have no idea
there's a way to defeat it.
You're wrong about my father.
- He did build it.
- Because he knew they'd do it without him.
My father made a choice.
He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion.
He's rigged a trap inside it
That's why he sent you.
To bring that message.
Where is it?
Where's the message?
It was a hologram.
You have that message, right?
Everything happened so fast.
Did you see it?
You don't believe me.
I'm not the one
you've got to convince.
I believe her.
That's good to know.
What kind of trap?
You said your father made a trap.
The reactor
He's placed a weakness there.
He's been hiding it for years.
He said if you can blow the reactor-
the module- the whole system goes down.
You need to send word
to the Alliance.
I've done that.
They have to know
there's a way to destroy this thing.
- They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.
- I can't risk sending that.
We're in the heart of Imperial territory.
Then we'll find him.
And bring him back,
and he can tell them himself.
Course set for Eadu, sir.
I'm one with the Force
and the Force is with me.
20 egress to the right.
10 degrees up.
No, no, no, lower.
Lower!
Are you sure this is the way?
They have landing trackers.
They have patrol squadrons.
You've got to stay in the canyon,
keep it low.
Watch your right!
There's a 26% chance of failure.
How much farther?
I don't know.
I'm not sure, I never really come this way,
but we're close, we're close.
I know that.
- Well, now there's a 35% chance of failure.
- I don't want to know, thank you.
I understand.
- Now! Put it down now!
- The wind...
If you keep going, you'll be
right over the shuttle depot.
- Watch out!
- Hey!
Hold on tight!
We're coming down hard!
- Try them again.
- I am, sir. We...
The signal's gone dead.
Squadron up, target Eadu.
How about now, check stabilizers?
- Bodhi, where's the lab?
- The research facility?
Yeah.
Where is it?
It's just over the ridge.
And that's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us?
You are sure of that?
Yes.
We'll have to hope there's still
an Imperial ship left to steal.
Here's what we're doing.
Hopefully, the storm keeps up
and keeps us hidden down here.
Bodhi, you're coming with me.
We'll go up the ridge
and check it out.
I'm coming with you.
No, your father's message,
we can't risk it.
You're the messenger.
That's ridiculous. We all got the message.
Everyone here knows it.
One blast to the reactor module
and the whole system goes down.
That's how you said it.
The whole system goes down.
Get to work fixing our comms!
All I want to do right now is get a
handle on what we're up against.
So, we're going to go very small and very carefully
up the rise and see what's what.
Let's get out of here.
Does he look like a killer?
No.
He has the face of a friend.
Who are you talking about?
Captain Andor.
Why do you ask that? What do you mean,
does he look like a killer?
The Force moves darkly near
a creature that's about to kill.
His weapon was in the
sniper configuration.
No, no, no...
We got to go up.
You can't see much from down there.
This way.
I'll be right behind you.
Come on.
Where are you going?
I'm going to follow Jyn.
Her path is clear.
Alone?
Good luck!
I don't need luck,
I have you!
What are they doing?
If Cassian comes back,
we're leaving without them.
You see Erso out there?
We've come too far.
Patience, my friend.
That's him.
That's him, Galen, in the dark suit.
Get back down there,
and find us a ride out of here.
What are you doing?
- You heard me.
- You said we came up here just to have a look
I'm here, I'm looking.
Go.
Hurry!
Excellent news, Galen.
The battle station is complete.
You must be very proud.
Proud as I can be, Krennic.
Gather your engineers,
I have an announcement.
Is that all of them?
- Yes.
Gentlemen.
One of you betrayed the Empire.
One of you has conspired with a pilot
to send messages to the Rebellion.
And I urge that traitor step forward.
Very well, I'll consider it a group effort, then.
Ready!
- No.
- No, please.
Aim...
- and...
- No, no.
- fire!
- Stop! Stop! Krennic, stop. It was me.
It was me.
They have nothing to do with it.
Spare them.
Fire!
How do I know
the weapon is complete?
Let me share with you some details..
Cassian.
Cassian, can you hear me?
I'm here.
You got it working.
Affirmative yes, although we have a problem!
There's an Alliance squadron approaching.
- Clear the area!
- No. No, no, no!
Tell them to hold up!
Jyn's on that platform!
Jedha.
Saw Gerrera.
His band of fanatics.
Their Holy City.
The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone.
You'll never win.
Now where have I heard that before?
Relay from Captain Andor.
- General.
- Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support.
Alliance forces onsite.
Please confirm.
Get the squadron leader on,
Get him on now!
They're already engaged, sir.
Dead
No.
Return fire!
To your stations.
Get our fighters in the air now!
Father!
- Go, go, go, go.
- Fall back! Fall back!
Director, we need to evacuate.
Papa.
Papa, it's me.
It's Jyn.
Jyn.
Stardust.
Papa.
I've seen
your message.
The hologram, I've seen it.
It must be destroyed
I know.
I know.
We will.
Jyn.
Look at you.
I've so much to tell you.
Papa.
No. No
Papa
Papa! Come on.
Over there, take them down.
Come on.
- Jyn, we've got to go. Come on.
- I can't leave him,
Listen to me.
He's gone.
There's nothing you can do.
Come on.
- I can't leave him.
- Come on!
- Help me.
- Move!
Down!
Come on.
Come on.
Well done.
You're a Rebel now.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, let's move!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Move, move, move.
Okay, K-2, let's go.
Copy that.
- Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm.
- Understood.
You lied to me.
You're in shock.
You went up there to kill my father.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Deny it
You're in shock,
and looking for someplace to put it.
- I've seen it before.
- I bet you have.
They know.
You lied about why we came here and
you lied about why you went up alone.
I had every chance to pull the trigger.
But did I?
Did I?
You might as well have.
My father was living proof and you put him at risk.
Those were Alliance bombs
that killed him!
I had orders!
Orders that I disobeyed!
- But you wouldn't understand that.
- Orders?
When you know they're wrong?
You might as well be a stormtrooper.
What do you know?
We don't all have the luxury of deciding when
and where we want to care about something.
Suddenly the Rebellion is
real for you?
Some of us live it.
I've been in this fight
since I was 6 years old.
You're not the only one
who lost everything.
Some of us just decided
to do something about it.
You can't talk your way around this.
I don't have to.
Yavin Four!
Make sure they know we're
coming in with a stolen ship.
Anybody else?
My lord, Director Krennic has arrived.
Director Krennic.
Lord Vader.
You seem unsettled.
No.
Just pressed for time.
There're a great many things to attend
to.
My apologies.
You do have a great
many things to explain.
I've delivered the weapon
the Emperor requested
I deserve an audience to make certain
he understands its remarkable potential.
Its power to create problems
has certainly been confirmed.
A city destroyed.
An Imperial facility openly attacked.
It was Governor Tarkin
that suggested the test.
You were not summoned here to grovel,
Director Krennic.
- No, I...
- There is no Death Star.
The Senate has been informed that
Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.
Yes, my lord.
I expect you to not rest until
you can assure the Emperor
that Galen Erso has not compromised
this weapon in any way.
So I'm still in command?
You'll speak to the Emperor about
Be careful not to choke
on your aspirations, Director.
We must scatter the fleet.
We have no recourse but to surrender.
Are we really talking about disbanding
something that we've worked so hard to create?
- We can't just give in.
- We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact!
- We've only now managed to gather our forces.
- Gather our forces?
General Draven's already blown up
an Imperial base!
A decision needed to be made.
If it's war you want,
you'll fight alone!
If that's the way it's going,
why have an Alliance at all?
If she's telling the truth,
we need to act now!
Councilors, please!
It is simple, the Empire has the means of
mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.
A Death Star, this is nonsense.
What reason would my father have to lie?
What benefit would it bring him?
To lure our forces into a final battle.
To destroy us once and for all.
To risk everything, based on what?
The testimony of a criminal?
The dying words of her father,
an Imperial scientist?
Don't forget the Imperial pilot.
My father gave his life so that
we may have a chance to defeat this.
So you've told us.
If the Empire has this kind of power,
what chance do we have?
What chance do we have?
The question is 'What choice?'
Run? Hide? Plead for mercy?
Scatter your forces?
You give way to an enemy
this evil with this much power
and you condemn the galaxy
to an eternity of submission.
- The time to fight is now!
- Yes.
Every moment you waste is another
step closer to the ashes of Jedha.
- What is she proposing?
- Just let the girl speak!
Send your best troops to Scarif.
Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to.
We need to capture the Death Star plans
if there is any hope of destroying it.
You're asking us to invade an Imperial
installation based on nothing but hope?
Rebellions are built on hope.
There is no hope.
I say we fight.
I say the Rebellion is finished.
I'm sorry, Jyn.
Without the full support
of the council,
the odds are too great.
General Bendola,
please report to the briefing room.
You don't look happy.
- They prefer to surrender.
- And you?
- She wants to fight.
- So do I. We all do.
The Force is strong.
I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.
- How many do we need?
- What are you talking about?
They were never going to believe you.
I appreciate the support.
But I do.
I believe you.
We'd like to volunteer
Some of us...
... most of us,
we've done terrible things
on behalf of the Rebellion.
We're spies.
Saboteurs. Assassins.
Everything I did,
I did for the Rebellion.
And every time I walked away from
something I wanted to forget
I told myself it was for a cause
that I believed in.
A cause that was worth it.
Without that, we're lost.
Everything we've done would
have been for nothing.
I couldn't face myself
if I gave up now.
None of us could.
It won't be comfortable.
It'll be a bit cramped,
but we'll all fit.
We could go.
Okay.
Gear up.
Grab anything that's not nailed down.
Go, go, go!
Jyn.
I'll be there for you.
Cassian said I had to.
I'm not used to people sticking around
when things go bad
Welcome home.
Bravo team to the Intelligence office
for extraction mission report.
May the Force be with us.
Cargo shuttle, read back, please.
What's going on out there?
That ship's off limits. No one is suppose
to be on board until farther instructions.
Yes, yes we are.
Affirmative.
That's an impounded Imperial ship.
What's your call sign, pilot?
- Um.
- We have to go.
It-It's um...
Say something.
Come on.
Rogue...
Rogue One.
Rogue One?
There is no Rogue One.
Well, there is now.
- Rogue One, pulling away.
- Pulling away.
Despite what the others say,
war is inevitable
Yes, I agree.
I must return to Alderaan
to inform my people
that there will be no peace.
We will need every advantage.
Your friend, the Jedi.
He served me well
during the Clone Wars
and has lived in hiding
since the Emperor's purge.
Yes, I will send for him.
You'll need someone you can trust.
I would trust her with my life.
- Captain Antilles, I have a mission for you.
- Senator.
Okay, we're coming in.
There's a planetwide defensive shield
with a single main entry gate.
This shuttle should be equipped with
an access code that allows us through.
Assuming, the Empire hasn't
logged it as overdue.
And if they have?
Then,they shut the gate and we're all
annihilated in the cold, dark vacuum of space.
Not me,
I can survive in space.
Okay.
Here it goes
Cargo shuttle SW-0608
requesting a landing pad.
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,
you're not listed on the arrival schedule.
Acknowledged, Gate Control.
We were rerouted from Eadu Flight Station.
- Transmitting clearance code now.
- Transmitting.
Cargo shuttle SW-0608?
-You are cleared for entry.
- Yes!
Impressive.
I'll tell the others.
Okay.
SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9.
Acknowledge, please.
SW-0608 proceeding to LP9 as instructed.
The main building down there,
what is it?
That's the Citadel Tower.
They keep all the Imperial structure archives in there.
If the plans are anywhere,
they'll be there.
The dish at the top?
What's it for?
I guess it takes a lot of signals
to send those data files out.
Landing track engaged
Landing track locked.
We're landing.
We're coming in!
Saw Gerrera used to say,
One fighter with a sharp stick
and nothing left to lose
can take the day.
They have no idea we're coming.
They have no reason to expect us.
If we can make it to the ground,
we'll take the next chance.
And the next.
On and on until we win...
or the chances are spent.
The Death Star plans are down there.
Cassian, Kay-Tu, and I will find them.
We'll find a way to find them.
Melshi, Pao, Baze, Chirrut,
you'll take main squad,
move east and get wide of the ship.
Find a position between here and the
tower.
Once you get to the best spot,
light the place up.
- Make ten men feel like a hundred.
- All right.
And get those troopers away from us.
What should I do?
Keep the engine running.
You're our only way out of here.
Cargo shuttle SW-0608,
be prepared to receive inspection team.
Ready?
Hello.
Hey, you're probably looking for a manifest
That would be helpful.
It's just down here.
Director Krennic, we are entering
the Scarif shield gate.
General Ramda has been informed
of your arrival.
Good luck, little sister.
Go!
Go now, you're clear!
All right, let's go.
Come on. Move, move, move.
I have a bad feeling about
- Kay!
- Quiet.
What?
We need a map.
Well, I'm sure there's one
just lying about.
You know what you have to do.
One per pad. Pick your spot.
We want to draw them out.
I'll call the timing.
Go!
Hey, did you hear the rumors?
Yeah, the T-15s have been
marked obsolete.
Oh boy, it's about time for that.
- Hey.
- Watch out.
What the...?
Director, what brings you to Scarif?
Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission
he has ever sent called up for inspection.
All of them?
Yes. All of them.
Get started.
Kay?
Our optimal route to the data vault
places only 89 stormtroopers in our path.
We will make it no more than 33%
of the way before we are killed.
Melshi,
talk to me.
Ready, ready.
Standing by.
Light it up.
Are we blind?
Deploy the garrison! Move!
Troopers!
Troopers.
Troopers on the left!
Sir? Scarif base,
they're reporting a rebel incursion.
I want to speak to Director Krennic.
He's there, sir.
On Scarif.
The original plans for this station
are kept there, are they not?
They are.
Prepare for the jump to hyperspace
and inform Lord Vader.
Can I help you?
That won't be necessary.
Senator!
Senator.
Stop right there, Private.
Let him speak.
Intercepted Imperial transmission, ma'am.
Rebels on Scarif.
I need to speak to Admiral Raddus
He's returned to his ship
He's gone to fight.
No!
Attention all flight personnel,
please report to your commanders immediately.
Attention all flight personnel,
please report to your commanders immediately.
We have been redirected to Scarif.
Pilots, you'll be briefed by
you squadron leaders on route.
May the Force be with you.
Scarif?
They're going to Scarif?
- Why does nobody ever tell me anything, Artoo?
- Yeah, nobody tells us anything.
Fall back!
Fall back!
Keep drawing them out!
- Go. Go.
- Move. Move.
Come on, move up!
Pad 12 report to ground.
Coming at our flank, we're outnumbered.
Pad 12 team, what's going on down there.
Status, please.
All Pads report in immediately.
Unknown, we have rebels everywhere.
We're taking fire, Pad 12, Pad 14
request assistance.
This is Pad 2, Pad 2.
I spot 40 rebels heading west on Pad 2.
Get on there, tell him
pinned down by rebels on Pad 5.
This is Pad 5, we're being overrun.
Help us!
Pad 12, Pad 10, Pad 8, please confirm.
Confirm and report.
Get reinforcements down to
Pad 5 immediately!
This is not working, Kay.
Right hand.
Baze!
- Baze!
- What?
Run!
Retreat.
Retreat!
This is Admiral Raddus of the Rebel Alliance.
All Squadron leaders report in.
Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by.
This is Gold Leader, standing by.
This is Red Leader, standing by.
Sir, those are rebel ships.
Get Admiral Gorin, immediately.
Director, the rebel fleet,
it's amassing outside the shield.
Lock down the base.
Lock down.
- And close the shield?
- Do it!
Red and Gold squadron, attack formations.
Defend the fleet.
Blue squadron, get to the surface
before they closed that gate.
Copy, your Admiral.
Blue squadron, on me.
- Copy, Blue Leader.
- Copy, Blue Leader.
We won't have long.
Close the field.
Close it!
Come on, come on, come on!
Pull up!
- Rebel fleet has arrived.
- What?
There's fighting on the beach,
they've locked down the base,
- they've closed the shield gate.
- What does that mean?
We're trapped?
We could transmit the plans
to the rebel fleet.
We'd have to get a signal out
to tell them it's coming.
It's the size of the data files.
That's the problem.
They'll never get through.
Someone has to take
that shield gate down.
Bodhi.
Bodhi, can you hear me?
Bodhi, tell me you're out there.
Bodhi!
Hello, I'm here.
We're standing by.
They've started fighting,
the base is on lockdown!
I know, listen to me!
The rebel fleet is up there.
You've got to tell them to
blow a hole in the shield gate
so we can transmit the plans
Wait, I can't. I'm not hooked into
the comm tower. We're not tied in.
It's the only way
we're getting them out of here.
Find a way!
Cover our backs.
You'll need this.
You wanted one, right?
Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected.
Jyn.
Come on.
Fire on my command.
Look!
Get ready.
We're going to have to go out there.
What're you doing?
They closed the shield gate,
we're stuck here.
But, the rebel fleet is pulling in.
We just have to get a signal
strong enough to get through to them
and let them know
we're trapped down here.
For that, we have to connect to
the communications tower.
Now, I can patch us in over here,
the landing pad
but you have to get on the radio,
get one of the guys out there to find
a master switch.
Get them to activate the connection between
us and that comm tower. Okay.
Then go!
What's going on down there, Lieutenant?
Unknown, sir.
We can't raise them.
All rebel frequencies are blocked.
Keep trying. Engage those Star Destroyers
and let's start probing that shield.
Yes, sir.
We're going in.
Stay with me.
Schematics bank, Data tower two.
- How do I find that?
- Searching.
I can locate the tape, but you'll need
the handles for extraction.
What are we supposed to do with these?
Whoa.
- Well, finally.
- Wait, stop.
The rebels!
They wentover there.
Kay.
What's going on out there?
There's one.
Oh well.
Come on!
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader,
we're starting our attack run
on the shield gate.
Keep it tight and watch out
for those towers.
More fighters.
Form up, at 65.
Sir, enemy fighters coming in.
Melshi.
Melshi, come in, are you there?
Bodhi will send a signal from here.
He's patching us in.
But you guys have to
open up a line for the tower.
How?
Please advise.
There's a master switch to the base
of the Comm tower.
Master switch, describe,
what are we looking for?
What does it look like, the master switch?
Where is it?
Two wings, reinforce those troops
on the beach.
All fighters, on me.
We have to shield them from air attack.
Troop reinforcements.
Here we go.
- For Jedha!
- Jedha!
We have no effect on that shield.
How much more can that thing take?
Stick close, Red 5,
where are you going?
I'm trying to lose them.
This is Red 5, I need help!
Hyperspace Tracking,

you can broadcast from the tower!

Send my guard squadron into battle!
Two men with me now!
Get that beach under control!
Bodhi?
Are you there?
Have you got the switch?
I can't get to the shuttle,
I can't plug in!
You have to!
They have to hit that gate.
If the shield's open,
we can send the plans!
General, behind you!
Take them out.
Step back.
We're going down!
Come on!
Look out.
Melshi.
Melshi, come in please.
I'm tied in at my end,
I just need an open line.
Hang on.

Deflector shield's down to 50%,
we're sustaining heavy damage.
There's no turning back now,
we have to press the attack.
Hit that opening.
We see it, Gold Leader.
Ion torpedoes away.
- What's happening?
- We've lost engine power, sir.
That Star Destroyer is disabled.
This is Rogue One, calling any
Alliance ships that can hear me!
Is there anybody up there? This is Rogue One!
Come in, over.
This is Admiral Raddus, Rogue One,
we hear you!
We have the plans!
They found the Death Star plans. They have
to transmit them from the communications tower!
You have to take down the shield gate.
It's the only way to going to get them through!
Call up a Hammerhead corvette.
I have an idea.
- Standby, Rogue One, we're on it.
- This is for you, Galen,
The Force is with me.
I'm one with the Force.

You know who I am.
I'm Jyn Erso.
Daughter of Galen and Lyra.
You've lost.
Oh, I have, have I?
My father's revenge.
He built a flaw in the Death Star.
He put a fuse in the
middle of your machine
and I've just told the
entire galaxy how to light it.
The shield is up, your signal
will never reach the rebel base.
All you ships in here
will be destroyed.
I lose nothing but time.
YOU on the other hand
die with the Rebellion.
Transmitting.
Transmitting.
Admiral, receiving transmission from Scarif.
Hey, leave it.
Leave it.
That's it.
That's it.
Let's go.
Transmission received.
Admiral, we have the plans!
She did it.
Do you think,
anybody is listening?
I do.
Someone's out there.
Sir, we're detecting a massive object
emerging from hyperspace.
Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet?
Lord Vader will handle the fleet.
Target the base at Scarif.
Single reactor ignition
Yes, sir.
You may fire when ready.
Commence primary ignition.
Rogue One, may the Force be with you.
All ships, prepare for jump to hyperspace!
You father would have been
proud of you, Jyn.
The rebel flag ship is disabled, my lord,
but has received transmission
from the surface.
Prepare a boarding party.
Yes, my lord.
Hurry!
Let go!
We got to go now.
Hurry, let's go.
It's stuck.
Hey, help!
Open fire!
Help us!
It's jammed.
Push!
Here. Here.
Take it! Take it.
LAUNCH!
Make sure you secure the airlock.
And prepare the escape pods.
Your Highness.
The transmission we received.
What is it they've sent us?
Hope.


Hi.
I'm Dory.
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.
Yes!
-That's exactly what you say.
Okay, okay.
We'll pretend to be
the other kids now.
Hi, Dory.
-Ahoy, there.
Do you want to
play hide and seek?
Okay.
I love to.
We'll hide and you count
and come find us.
Okay, Daddy.
No, no.
Not daddy.
I'm the nice fish
who wants to be your friend.
Okay?
-Okay, Daddy.
No.
-I'm hiding.
Now count to 10.
1, 2, 3.
Uh.
4... um...
I like sand.
Sand is squishy.
Mommy, can I go
play with them?
Dory?
-Dory!
Dory, cupcake.
Dory, honey.
-Hold your toes, sweetie.
Remember, honey.
We have to stay away
from the undertow.
Okay, sweetheart.
What about the rhyme we learned.
We see the undertow
and we say.
Let's go.
No.
No.
It's, "Heck no!"
Okay?
Let's try it again.
We see the undertow
and we say.
There's the undertow.
There's the undertow.
There's the undertow.
There you find the undertow
and we see the undertow.
Did I forget again?
-No, no.
No, sweetie. It's okay.
-No biggie, cupcake.
What if I forget you?
Huh!
Would you ever forget me?
Oh cupcake, no.
-We will never forget you, Dory.
And we know
you'll never forget us.
FINDING
DORY
Hello?
Hello?
Did you hear that?
-What's that? Hear what?
Stan, I just...
I heard someone say hello.
Who?
I didn't hear anybody said hello.
I don't know, Stan.
I just heard someone say hello.
Yeah, there's a lot
of fish here.
Anybody, literally anybody
could have just said hello.
Hello?
There.
-Where?
There. There, right there.
-Wh-What am I look?
There.
-Oh.
Hello?
Hello.
-Oh my goodness, it's a child.
Hello.
-Hi, kid.
Hello.
-Over here. Hello?
Hi.
Hi, I'm Dory.
Can you please help me?
Oh hi, Dory.
Ar...
Dory, are you lost?
Where are your parents?
Umm.
I can't remember.
Oh.
-We'll look around. Uh.
Are any of this fish
your parents?
Hi, I'm Dory.
Can you please help me?
Huh?
-Um.
Honey, you just...
you just said that.
I did?
-Mm-hm.
I'm sorry.
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.
Oh, how awful.
-Short-term memory loss.
Okay, just...
You wait here for one second,
okay, sweetpie.
Stan. Stan. Stan.
-What? What?
What do I do?
The poor thing is lost.
I don't know.
I mean...
We have to do something.
-What do you want me to do? I mean...
She can't remember a thing!
-She could come from anywhere.
Well.
You are-You are no help today.
-I'm just...
Dory. sweeitie, how about we...
-Oh, she's gone.
Dory?
-That's not good.
Dory?
-Dory?
I'm Dory.
I lost my family.
Can you help me?
I'm Dory.
I suffer from short-term memory... huh!
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.
Hi. I lost my family.
Can you help me?
Where did you see them last?
-Well, uh...
Funny story.
But... I forgot.
Aw, sweetie.
Do you want to come swim with us?
That is the nicest offer
I've gotten all day.
I... I think.
I can't remember.
Anywho, thanks.
But, heheh, I'm looking for someone.
Oh,
Can't remember.
Can't remember.
Hi!
I'm Dory.
Was it something I said?
Kidding. Okay, okay.
You're not coming back.
I was looking for something
and I...
Okay, totally get it.
Date night. Have fun.
Well. I hope you find whatever
it is you are looking for.
You and me both.
Any idea what that was?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Guess we'll hang out another time.
Don't be a stranger... stranger.
Huh?
A white boat!
They took my son!
My son!
Help me, please!
LOOK OUT!
Oh. Oh.
Sorry!
Are you-Are you okay?
He's gone. He's gone.
-There, there.
No, he's gone.
-It's alright.
He's gone.
-It'll be okay.
No. No.
They took him away!
I... I have to find the boat.
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat.
-You have?
Uh-huh. This way!
It went this way.
Follow me.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
one year later
Hand me the ratchet wrench.
So I can fix it.
Ow!
Hey, Marlin.
Oh.
Hey, guys.
I was just...
Ow ow ow...
Dory, it's not time
to get up yet.
You have to go back to bed.
-Remember. There aren't any mistakes.
Alright.
Yeah, sorry.
Back to bed.
Back to bed.
Hey, Marlin.
Oww!
Go back to bed.
That was it.
Very simple, bed.
-Ah.
Back to...
-Got it.
Hey, Marlin.
-And... we're up.
That's it, ready to start the day.
And we were looking
for something.
Nemo.
-Right.
I remember it like
it was yesterday.
Of course I don't really
remember yesterday all that well.
Anyway.
I would say, the scariest moment
of the trip was the 4 sharks.
Wait.
I thought there were 3 sharks.
No. No.
There were definitely 4.
But the last time you told it,
there were 3.
Son. Which one of us traveled
across the entire ocean.
Nemo did.
Obviously we had to cross
the ocean to find him. So...
You know, he went first.
I guess that's true.
Isn't it?
Well.
You made it.
You almost missed the field trip.
-A field?
Ooo, I love field trips.
Where are we going?
I thought you told her.
-I did tell her.
Uh, Dory.
-Yeah.
Mr. Ray has too many fish
to keep an eye on today.
Uh-huh.
-So.
It would be best if today...
-Um-hm.
If you weren't exactly...
with the class.
-Oh. Why not?
You know, you have problems
remembering things sometimes.
That's the one thing
I can't remember, yeah.
Okay.
Sometimes it's not your fault,
but it can cause you to wonder.
And Mr. Ray doesn't really
have time to worry about...
Fish who wonders.
-Sure.
In another words, he doesn't
have enough help.
Poor guy.
You know, he's so overworked.
You understand.
-I totally understand now.
Okay. Good.
-Mm-hm.
He wants me to be
the teacher's assistant.
Uh. No, not exactly.
-Well, I'm so honored.
I've never been a
teaching assistant before.
Mr. Ray, you got help.
Oh ho ho.
Okey-dokey!
Alright, kids.
-Alright, kids.
Today's the day.
-Today's the day.
- Field trip to the stingray migration.
-Stingray migration.
Now, does anyone know
why we migrate?
Come on, you got
to know this stuff.
Migration is about going back to...
Bed!
-Yes.
No.
-No.
The sand!
-No.
Migration is about going home.
-Home.
Which is where you are from.
-Where you are from.
Can someone tell me
where they are from.
I live by a giant rock.
I live 3 coral caves
away from here.
My house is covered in algae.
Where did you grow up, Dory?
-Me?
Um.
I don't know.
My family.
Where are they?
Can I help you?
I'm sorry. Did I forget again?
See, I suffer from...
Short-term memory loss.
-Short-term memory loss.
So how can you remember you have a
family if you have short-term memory loss?
Good question.
Good question.
See, I can remember somethings
because well, they make sense.
Like... what.
I have a family.
I-I know, because I... You know,
I must've come from somewhere, right?
Everyone has a family.
And I may not remember
their names and
what they look like.
And I may not even be able
to ever find them again. But...
What are we talking about?
-Mommies and daddies.
Mommies and daddies, right.
Why are we talking about
mommies and daddies?
Oh. Oh.
That class.
Oh oh.
Why me? Okay.
You guys seem
really young but...
Okay.
You see, kids.
When 2 fish love each other...
And, we'll stop right there.
Climb aboard, explorers.
I feel a migration
song coming on.
Migration, migration, let's learn about migration.
It's nature's inspiration
to move around the sea.
Here's a scientific commerce.
Where did everyone go?
By myself...
Oh there they are and back.
What's minus 4 degrees
based on solar positioning.
Oh, kids.
Stay away from the edge.
Okay. You hear that.
Okay.
Everybody stay back from the edge.
Come on.
Okay, that's too far.
-That's too far, come on.
Come on, get back over here.
Back this way.
Now, I need everyone to listen.
-Alright, listen up.
When the rays pass through here,
-The rays, they are going to pass through.
What do we have to be careful of?
-Everybody has to be careful of what?
The undertow.
-The undertow.
That's right.
-That's right.
The under...
The undertow.
Because the current created
by all the flapping is very strong.
If you are not careful,
you can get pull in.
Mr. Ray. So how do the stingrays
all know where to go?
That's what an instinct is, Nemo.
Something deep inside you
that feels so familiar that
... you have to listen to it.
Like a song you've always known.
And I can hear mine now!
Our hearts know where to go.
Oh, we're going home.
Whoa.
-Whoa.
To make our way back home.
Oh, we're going home.
Wow.
We, see the undertow.
And we sang...
AH!
Dory!
-Dory!
Dory.
Dory.
Huh!
Is she dead?
No, she's not dead.
Give her some space, everybody.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
Oh. I remembered something.
It's uh.
Huh!
I remembered something.
I actually remembered something.
Something important.
Something important, what?
What was it?
I'm not sure anymore.
But I can still feel it, it's...
Alright.
Thank you, Mr. Ray.
Try to remember better.
Don't be such a dory, Dory.
Uh. Oh!
Oh!
What?
Did you remember?
I don't remember.
It was something.
It was...
Oh, oh, oh.
It was something about... the...
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
Huh!
My family!
I remember my family!
They are out there somewhere.
I have to find them.
Guys, you got to help me.
Guys.
Guys, hello?
Guys, where are you?
Dory.
-Hello?
Dory.
Ah.
Where did you go?
-You were the one who go.
My parents.
I remembered them.
What?
What did you remember?
I remember them.
My mom, my dad!
I have a family!
Oh.
They don't know where I am.
Let's go. We have to go.
-Dory. No.
No!
This is crazy.
Where exactly are you
trying to go?
To the... To the...
gym of the... Baltic.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
-Yes!
No, Dory. California is all
the way across the ocean.
Then we better get going.
-How come everytime
we're on the edge of this reef,
one of us is trying to leave?
For once, can't we
just enjoy the view.
How can you be talking about the view
when I remembered my family.
No! No!
We've done our ocean travels.
That part of our lives is over.
The only reason to travel
in the first place, is so you
don't have to travel ever again.
Yeah, but I want to...
Dory, look.
-Please.
All I know.
Is that I missed them.
I really, really missed them.
I didn't know what that felt like.
Do you know
what that feels like?
Yes.
I know what that feels like.
I don't want to forget this.
Somewhere out there
is my family.
Please, Marlin.
I can't find them on my own.
I'll forget.
Please help me find my family.
Yeah, Dad.
You can get us all the way
across the ocean. Right?
No.
But I know a guy.
Woo hoo!
Righteous!
Righteous!
Hoo hoo!
Ta-day!
Totally sick!
Totally sick!
I know.
Isn't it great?
No!
I'm going to be totally sick.
It's the California current, dude.
Got some abhorrent job.
Surf's up, dude.
-Aw!
Hey, dude,
if you're going to hurl,
just do me a solid.
Head to the back of the shell.
Lean out and
go for distance.
We call that,
"Feeding the fishes!"
And now, we are looking
for my parents at
the brooch of the
Atlantic or the...
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
-Exactly.
How are you going
to find your parents?
Do you remember what
they looked like?
I'm a bit new to the memory
thing so I can't say for sure.
But something tells me
they were mostly blue with...
... maybe yellow.
-That sounds right.
Also, I'm pretty sure I'm going
to know them when I see them.
We're family.
By the way, crossing the ocean is the
kind of thing you should only do once.
One time!
-Morro bay, California's coming up, dudes.
Woo hoo!
Let's find my family.
Go! Go!
Go, go, go!
Just go, Dad!
-Don't push me, Nemo.
Woo!
-Ahh!
Woo hoo!
Ha ha.
So long, little blue.
I hope you find your parents.
And good luck feeding the fishes.
Too late, I already fed.
Oh.
This feels familiar.
Mom!
Dad!
Dory. Dory. Dory.
Wait. Wait.
Mom! Dad!
-Stop yelling for a second.
Do you really think your parents
are just going to be
floating around here waiting for you?
Well, I... I don't know but
there's only one way to find out.
Mom! Dad!
-Shout louder, Dory.
MOM! DAD!
-Shhh shh shh.
Huh!
What was that?
Wait.
I heard that before.
I remembered someone
saying shh shh shh.
Yes, well done.
That was me, 1 minute ago.
Shh shh shh.
-Huh!
Please, have you seen
my mommy and daddy?
Their names are
Jenny and Charlie.
Shh shh shh.
-Shh shh shh.
Huh!
Jenny and Charlie.
What? Jenny and what?
-Those are their names.
My parents are
Jenny and Charlie!
Shh shh shh.
-Dory, wait!
Jenny!
-Can't we just take a moment
Charlie!
- to come up with a plan.
Jenny! Charlie!
-Shh shh shh.
Are you crazy?
-Sorry, she's-she's a little excited.
Jenny! Charlie!
-Dory. Dory. Stop yelling for a second.
It's not a good idea to come
into a new neighborhood
and call this much
attention to yourself.
You don't understand.
I remembered my parents names.
Jenny Charlie!
-Dory. Dory.
These crabs are locals.
And I get the feeling they are
shushing us for a reason.
You might wake up something dangerous.
-Are you talking about.
Like something with one big eye,
tentacles and a snappy thing?
Well, that's very specific.
But something like that, yes.
You just in general
don't want to...
Oh, hi.
-Oh boy.
Goodness.
Okay.
We made a mistake.
We're backing away.
Let us live.
And we will...
We'll worship you.
We'll build a...
-Uh.
Do you like a...
Do you like a monument?
Ahh!
-Ahh!
Whoa!
Swim for your life!
Nemo!
-Nemo!
Nemo!
-Dad!
Nooo!
Nemo, hold on to me!
And don't let go!
Dory! Dory.
Dory, slow down.
We're not being chased anymore.
-Are you sure?
AH!
Jenny.
Jenny and Charlie.
Jenny and Charlie!
Jen...
I just-I just remembered their names.
We have to keep going,
we're so close. Huh?
Are you hurt?
Huh!
Oh my goodness, Nemo.
Are you okay? What happened?
-Not now, Dory. Please.
Oh no. Oh no. Nemo.
-I'm okay. I'm okay.
Oh no. Oh, Nemo.
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
Huh!
Oh my goodness.
Nemo, are you okay?
-I said not now.
You've done enough.
-I have?
Oh no.
But I... I can fix it.
I can.
I'll go get help.
You know what you can do, Dory?
You can go wait over there.
Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best.
You're right.
I don't know why I thought
I could do this.
Find my family, I can't do this.
I'm so sorry.
I'll fix it.
-I'm okay.
Well.
I'm going to get help, okay?
Okay? I can do that.
I'll-I'll be...
It will be alright, Nemo.
Hello?
Someone, hello.
Anyone?
Hello.
Anyone?
-Hello.
Hello?
-I'm Sigourney Weaver.
Oh. Hi, Sigourney.
I need your help.
Won't you please join us.
-Oh, Great, great, great.
As we explore the wonders
of the Pacific ocean
and the amazing life
it holds within.
Sigourney?
Sigourney Weaver, where are you?
Dory, there you are!
-Guys, I found help.
Sigourney Weaver is going to
tell us where we are.
Look out!
-Ah!
Aw. Look at this.
-No respect for ocean life.
Marlin! Nemo!
-Dory!
No, no, no.
Not again! Not again!
Let's take her inside
and see how she does.
Dory! Dory!
-Don't worry, Dory!
Keep calm!
We'll come find you!
And welcome to the
Marine Life Institute,
where we believe in rescue,
rehabilitation and release.
Marlin?
Nemo?
Hello? Hello?
Can you help me?
Me? Help you?
Ah-choo!
Ehhh.
AHH!
Ah!
Huh!
Huh!
Huh?
What's happening?
Help.
-Looks like we're done here.
Dude, cut it out.
You're a scientist.
We've talked about this.
Oh, come on.
It's funny.
Okay.
Okay.
Just get a hold of yourself.
Ah!
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
Hey, you.
-Oh.
Spinner.
-Huh! Thank goodness.
Hi, I'm Dory. I'm...
-Name's Hank.
How sick are you?
-Sick? I'm sick?
Why else would you
be in quarantine.
Oh no.
How long do I have?
I have to find my family.
-Alright now. Don't get hysterical.
Oh oh.
Not good.
What? What is it?
What happened?
Huh! What's that?
-That there, is bad news.
It's a transport tag for fish who
can't cut it inside the institute.
They get transferred
to permanent digs.
An aquarium in Cleveland.
Fish in here,
go back into the ocean.
Cleveland fish, stay there forever.
-Huh!
Cleveland, no!
I can't go to the Cleveland.
I have to get to the jewel of Morro bay,
California, and find my family.
That's this place,
The Marine Life Institute.
The jewel of Morro bay, California.
You're here.
-You mean I'm from here?
My parents are here.
I have to get to them.
So what exhibit are you from?
-Wait. I'm from an exhibit?
Which one?
I have to get there.
That's a hard one, kid.
Unless.
Nah. It'd never work.
It's too crazy.
What do you mean? Just tell me.
I'm okay with crazy.
You know I can see that.
Well, there's one thing I can think of
to help you get to your family.
If I just take...
-Yes! Great idea.
You take me to find them.
Why didn't I think of that?
Uh. No, no, no.
If I just take your tag.
I can take your place
on the transport truck.
Then you can go back inside
and find your family.
All you have to do
is give me the tag.
What tag? Huh!
There's a tag on my fin.
Huh? How can you forget
you have a tag on your fin?
Oh no. I' sorry.
I...
I suffer from
short-term memory loss.
You don't remember what
we were talking about?
Mm-mm, not a clue.
What were we talking about?
Um.
You were about to
give me your tag.
Well, I kind of like my tag.
Why-Why do you want it?
SO I CAN GO TO...!
So that I can go to Cleveland.
-Cleveland.
I hear good things about Cleveland.
Why do you want to go there.
Because if I stay here I'm going
to get released back into the ocean.
And I have extremely unpleasant
memories of that place!
I just want to live
in a glass box alone.
That's all I want.
GIVE ME YOUR TAG!
Hey, man.
Don't touch my tag.
Look.
I don't work here.
It's not like I have
a map of this place.
Huh! A map.
Good idea.
You take me to the map.
I figure out where my parents are.
Oh boy.
Alright.
If I get you to your family
will you give me...
I don't have much.
Um.
I... How about if
I give you this tag.
Great idea.
Are you absolutely sure
that's what I said?
"Go wait over there and forget.
That's what you do best."
Yeah, Dad.
-I said that?
You said that.
Dory swam to the surface, and
then she got taken by someone...
Alright, I don't want to
hear the whole story again.
I was just asking
about the one part.
Because, look, if I said that.
I'm not positive I did.
It's-It's actually a complement.
Because I asked her to wait.
And I said,
"It's what you do best."
So I...
I...
Oh, it's my fault!
It's all my fault!
She got kidnapped and taken into...
whatever this place is.
What if it's a restaurant?
Oy! You two.
Shut it.
Yeah, we're trying to sleep.
And you interrupted my favourite dream.
Is that the one about
you laying on this rock?
Yeah.
-Oh, that is a good one.
Oh. Yeah.
-It's one of my favorites.
Uh, Excuse us. Hello.
-Son. Son. Son.
We're trying...
-Those are sea lions.
They are natural predators.
They could pounce at any moment.
They don't look very pouncey.
-That's what they want you to think.
Just get behind me
and let me do the talking.
Excuse me.
We're worried about our friend.
Is that a restaurant?
Ah ha, mate.
It's not a restaurant.
Your friend is okay.
-She is?
It's a fish hospital.
Sigourney Weaver says,
she'll be rescued, rehabilitated
and released.
She'll be in and out in a jiff.
We should know.
Nasal parasite.
-Anemia.
All fixed up and
sent on our way.
Oh.
Thank goodness.
Sure. That's alright.
Don't you worry...
Oy! Gerald.
-Gerald! Get off!
Shove off!
-Get off, Gerald!
No, you know that! Off!
-You're not fond of.
Off!
-Off!
Don't you worry about a thing.
That place is the Marine Life Institute.
The jewel of Morro Bay, California.
Huh!
She was right.
Looks like Dory can do
something besides forget.
Thank you, Nemo.
Thank you for that.
So how are we
going to get inside?
Wait.
You want to get inside, me lad?
Desperately.
Our friend is in there, lost, alone.
She's scared.
She'll have no idea what to do.
Oh.
We know a way.
-You do?
What are they doing?
I don't know.
It sounds bad.
Are we there yet?
-Shh, keep it down.
Hank, I'm so glad
I found you.
It feels like... destiny.
For what must be the millionth time.
It's not destiny.
Oh oh.
Have I said destiny before?
I'm sorry.
I'm just so nervous
because I'm going
to meet my parents.
I hadn't seen them in...
I don't even know how long.
Because, you see I suffer from
short-term memory loss.
-Short-term memory loss.
Look. No more talking, okay?
I don't like talking.
I don't like chattering,
questions and...
"How are you?",
"Oh, I'm fine."
"How are you?",
"Oh, I'm fine too."
News flash.
Nobody's fine.
Oh, I'm fine.
How are you?
Hank, look.
There's a map.
Shhh. The plan is
you're going to read that.
And figure out
where your parents live.
And I'm on a truck
to Cleveland.
You got it?
-Got it.
What was the first part again?
-Oh.
What?
The octopus escaped again.
Wow.
Look at all the exhibits.
How can you do this park
in one day, seriously.
Pick one!
-Okay.
Well, tell everyone to
keep an eye out.
I mean, we're suppose to be releasing
the octopus back to the ocean today.
Well.
Of course I haven't seen it.
If I was looking...
Hey.
There you are.
Hurry up.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.
It starts with a 'K'.
[KID ZONE] font
color="#64cdff"[OPEN OCEAN] -Kiidd Zzz onee. Kid zone.
No. No, kids.
Kids grab things.
And I'm not losing
another tentacle for you.
You lost a tentacle?
Well, then you're not an octopus,
you're a septopus.
I may not remember
but I can count.
Hurry up!
-Okay.
Journey to the deep.
Hey look, shells.
Huh!
Hey look, shells.
Daddy, here's a shell for you.
-Oh, that's great, Dory.
You found another one.
-I did?
Oh yes, you did.
You're getting good at this, Dory.
Hey look, shells.
Hey, I live here.
-Yes. Yes indeed.
I like shells.
Ahaha.
That's right, dear.
Do you think you can
find me another shell?
The purple ones are my favourite.
Okay, Mommy.
Oh, Mommy.
Purple shell.
Purple shell.
Hank, my home had a purple shell.
-So what?
Half the exhibits here
have purple shells in them.
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
I remember her now.
Purple shells were her favourite.
And she had this adorable giggle
and my dad was really funny.
And now your wacky memories
are going to get us caught.
Still think this is destiny?
Hank, we need to find my folks.
-Quiet.
Base, this is Carol.
I think I might have
found that missing octopus.
See what you did?
-Sorry.
This could not be worse.
DES-TI-NY.
Huh, Destiny?
Come on.
-Hank.
Don't talk just hide.
-I got a feeling.
I think we should get into the bucket.
-No, stop.
Seriously, it says 'Destiny'.
And it is.
No, no, no, no, no.
-We got to get in that bucket.
I'm not going with you
in that bucket.
I go in that bucket.
-Don't. Don't go in that bucket!
Bye.
Hey, guys.
I'm looking for my family.
Oh, good idea.
Play dead.
I'm sorry.
I got to blink.
How do you hold your
eyes open that long?
Hey, guys.
Wait a second.
Ah!
Ah!
Our next guest, has been
here a very long time.
She's a whale shark.
Her name is Destiny.
Destiny, really?
You'll notice,
she's extremely near sighted.
And has trouble navigating
her environments.
Oh.
And here she comes now.
Ooo. Destiny.
Huh! You're a fish?
Wait.
What?
Hi. Hello there.
Can you help me?
Whoa!
Alright, I'll go with you.
Excuse me, hi.
-Who is that?
Is that blue blob talking?
Can you help me?
I lost my family.
You lost your family?
-Well, it's a long story.
And truth be told,
I don't remember most of it.
Oh, that is so sad.
You poor thing.
OW!
Sorry, not a great swimmer.
I can't see very well.
Oh.
I think you swim beautifully.
In fact, I've never seen a fish
swim like that before.
Thank youuu.
Youuuu're welcommme.
Wait.
Say that again.
Um.
Youuuu're welcommme.
Dory?
-Yes.
Dory.
-Yes.
Dory?
-Yes.
Ah, Dory.
-Yes.
You and I were friends!
-No.
Dory, it's me, Destiny.
-You know me?
Of course. We talked through
the pipes when we were little.
We were pipe-pals!
-We were?
Aw, you're so pretty.
So you know where I'm from?
-Yep.
You, are from the
open ocean exhibit.
Oh!
-I'm from the open ocean exhibit?
Then that's where my parents are.
We got to go.
Can you take me there?
Uh. Kind of tough for a whale
to travel around here.
Can you please keep it
down over there.
My head hurts.
-Who's that?
That's my neighbor, Bailey.
-Uh-huh.
He was brought in
with a head injury.
I know you're talking
about me, Destiny.
He thinks he can't
use his echolocation
but I overheard the doctors talking.
-I'm right here.
There's not a thing
wrong with him.
I can hear every word
you're saying about me.
What's echolocation?
Well, Bailey's head is suppose
to put out a call and the echo
helps him find objects far away.
Oh but apparently,
he's still healing.
Now I know you're
talking about me.
I really can... echolocate.
-Oh.
I cannot have this conversation again.
I just can't.
I hit my head very
hard out there.
See how swollen it is?
-Your head is suppose to be big.
You're a Beluga.
-Echolocation.
Oh. Like the world's most
powerful pair of glasses?
What?
-What are glasses?
Sort of like, you go wooo.
And then you see things.
Why do I know that?
Oh.
That's interesting.
There you are.
-Hank.
Listen up. You and I are square.
-Hank.
I took you to the map,
now give me that tag.
Wait, wait, wait.
No.
I know where my parents are.
They are in...
What's it called.
The place... it's... silted ocean.
Open ocean.
-Open ocean.
Open ocean!
-Huh!
Open ocean.
I know where that is!
That's the exhibit located
right next to, I don't care.
Easy.
-Huh!
If you are trying to get to
the open ocean exhibit,
just go through the pipes.
Through the pipes, great.
-Through the pipes?
Yep. Take two lefts.
Swim straight, and you'll hit it.
Oh, that's a lot of directions.
That's... Did you get that, Hank?
All that?
Uh, yeah.
-Great, let's go.
I'm not going with you.
I won't fit.
You'll have to go by yourself.
Um.
Uh. That's...
That... I'm...
See, I can't.
Because I'm not so good with directions.
Well, that's too bad.
A deal is a deal.
You want to find your parents.
That's how you get to them.
Now give me your tag.
-But, Hank.
I... can't go in the pipes alone.
I'll forget where I'm going.
Not my problem.
Tag.
But I can't get in that way.
Well, I'm sorry.
But there's no other way!
There's no other way.
Huh!
There's no other way.
Now, now, don't panic.
-No dear.
It's okay.
You know, not everything in life
is easy to do.
Isn't that right, Charlie?
Yeah.
Your mother's right.
When something is too hard, Dory.
You should just give up.
Charlie!
-A joke.
I'm kidding, just a joke.
-Okay.
A joke.
Uh, caution.
Joker at work.
-Joke, I got it.
You see, cupcake.
There's always another way.
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, Daddy.
Huh! Nope.
My father said there's always another way.
What?
There is no other way.
Open ocean. Open ocean.
Open ocean.
Open Ocean, I'm pretty sure
it's the building over there.
It's ill defined and roundish.
Like Bailey's head.
-Wait. What?
There's always another way.
There's always... huh!
There.
Guys, follow me.
I know how we can get to locomotion.
Open ocean. -Open
ocean. -Exactly.
Uh.
Guys.
Guys. You know I can't
swim over there, right?
I don't see how this is
going to get us inside.
What are you even doing?
-We're calling her over, of course.
Calling her over.
Calling who over?
Lads.
Meet Becky.
Flying?
No no no...
New information.
Listen, tell her thank you.
I mean, you guys have gone
above and beyond, really.
But is there a way to get in
that involves like swimming.
Because that's really our strength.
Look, your friend is going
to be in quarantine.
+ QUARANTINE
-That's where they take the sick fish.
And the one and only one way
into that place is Becky.
Hi, Becky.
Ow!
Stop.
Lets call her Pecky.
This is really...
-I think she likes you, Dad.
Becky, love.
These 2 nice fish need
to get into quarantine.
Are you free today, Rebecca darling?
Becky, is...
Would that work with your schedule?
Ow.
She doesn't understand what I'm saying.
All you have to do
is imprint with her, mate.
I'm... what?
Imprint.
-Imprint.
Look her in the eye
and say, Oorrooo.
And she'll be
in sync with you.
Now, look her in the eye.
-Yeah!
Nemo.
I think we should device
and alternate plan.
One that involves
staying in the water
That's all I'm saying.
Because this bird, this bird...
This ain't the bird!
-That's find, Dad.
And in the mean time,
Dory will just forget us.
Like you say.
It's what she does best.
Fine.
Uh, okay.
Look her in the eye.
Which-Which eye?
-Just pick one, mate.
Becky.
Oorroo, Becky.
Okay.
This is all great.
How exactly is Becky
suppose to carry us?
Oh, yeah.
I almost forgot.
Gerald.
Gerald.
Give us your pail.
We'll let you sit on the rock.
Yeah, Gerald.
We swear it.
That's right.
Chive on over here.
Come on, you can do it.
That's right.
-Mind your nose, scuff your bump.
Thank you so much, Gerald.
Welcome to your time
on this rock.
Comfortable, ain't it?
Time's up.
-Time's up.
Now get off!
-Get off, Gerald!
Off!
-Off!
This is nuts!
Why do I keep getting
talked into insane choices?
Good luck!
Okay.
When I tell you, you're gonna...
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm gonna signal with a big splash.
On my mark.
Not clear yet.
Not clear yet.
Now?
-Not till Destiny gives the signal.
You know something?
I've no idea why
you're even doing this.
What do you mean?
It seems like a lot of trouble
just to find some more fish.
If I had short-term memory loss,
I just swim off into the blue
and forget everything.
I don't want to do that.
I want my family.
Not me, kid.
I don't want anyone to worry about.
You're lucky, no memories.
No problems.
-Huh.
No memories, no problems.
Still not clear.
Still not clear.
You don't have to say it
when it's not time.
Not...
-Just tell me when it is time.
Okay, here we go.
And wait!
Here we go, wait.
Are you serious?
Okay, on the count of three.
Don't count, just say go.
-GO!
Now! Now!
Do it! Do it!
Wow, look at that.
I mean...
That's the signal!
-Go, go, go. That's the signal!
Now remember.
Destiny said, follow the signs to
the Open Ocean exhibit. -Uh-huh.
I can't see squat.
So it's your job to look for it.
Got it.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
I'm just going to repeat it, okay?
That should work.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Go right.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Follow the signs to Open Ocean.
Ow!
Left.
And steer clear of people, will you.
Especially kids.
I don't want to be touched.
-Shh. Do not mess me up.
Ah!
-Wah!
Oh, poor baby.
Let me get that for you.
Here you...
Woo!
Oh my.
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Oh, sorry.
Okay.
I was looking, looking...
Oorroo, Becky.
Drop us anywhere.
We're okay.
Just wait, Dad.
I think she's looking
for a place to land.
She's confuse, Nemo!
She doesn't even know
which way to look!
Wait, wait, wait!
Becky! Becky!
What are you doing?
Oorroo.
Oorroo roo roo roo.
Okay, it's going somewhere.
The question is where?
Which way?
Do you see the sign?
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
Something to something
that gets me to my family.
My family!
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.
I know that.
Why do I know that?
It's another memory.
Hank, we need to go that way.
Left.
Go-go left.
OPEN OCEAN
Becky.
Oorroo, oorroo.
She can't hear you, Dad.
Alright, alright, alright.
New plan.
We have to get closer to Becky
so she can hear us.
I don't think we should
move the pail.
Nemo.
Without me, Becky's lost.
Dad, just trust her.
-Trust her?
So she can forget us altogether?
I trust Becky.
-You trust Becky.
Becky's eating a cup.
Becky. Beck?
Oorroo.
GIFT SHOP
Well.
At least we're not stuck
in a bucket anymore.
We're on top of quarantine.
The baby otter tour
is beginning now.
Why, thanks, Sigourney Weaver.
Hey, who want's to
learn about otters?
Looking for the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.
Huh!
Otters!
It's a huge cuddle party!
Huh!
Cuddle party, I'm in.
Where are we?
Are we close to open ocean?
Uh, yes, I think.
Well, I don't know.
But I saw that other sign so...
-What? What other sign?
The world's most powerful
pair of glasses.
What?
What are you talking about?
Why would we follow that sign?
-Well... Because I remembered it.
No, no, no.
That wasn't the plan.
WAHH!
Alright, that's it!
You've wasted my time.
-Wait, no.
That transport truck leaves at dawn
and I'm not missing it.
So give me your tag.
-Wait. No.
Now I remember that sign.
-So?
So I'm remembering more and more
and I feel like my memory is getting better.
I think we should...
-NO! Your memory is not working!
You can't remember anything!
It's probably how you lost
your family in the first place!
Huh!
Alright. Look.
Let's just take it down a notch.
Just give me the tag, you know.
-You know something?
For a guy with 3 hearts
you're not very nice.
3 hearts?
What are you talking about?
I don't have 3 hearts.
-Yes, you do.
I don't.
-You do.
Don't.
-Do!
Stop saying that!
-Fun fact.
The octopus has 3 hearts.
2 pump blood to the gills.
-What?
While the third pumps blood
through out the body. -Wait.
KID ZONE
You know, someone with 3 hearts
shouldn't be so mean.
And it's mean to say that
I would lose someone I love!
INTERACTIVE
FISH POND
I did not lose them!
Hank?
Hank!
Hank?
Hands.
No, not Hans.
I'm looking for Hank.
Hands.
-Hank, with a 'k'. "Hankk."
Hands!
-Hands?
Oh, hands!
Hank!
Hank?
My arm!
-Hank!

Where are you, Hank?!
Can you please help me?
I'm looking for...
Please help me.
I've lost my friend, Frank.
I'm sorry, not Frank.
-You're in my space!
He's an octopus.
No, sep-septopus.
He-That's right, he's a septopus.
Septopus. Septopus. Septopus.
Huh!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, septopus.
He's camouflaged.
Hank.
Come on, Hank.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, what are you doing?
-Hank!
Wh-Wh-What's the plan?
The plan is I'm going to
stay here forever.
Okay.
Good plan.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Hank.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.
Huh!
Sweetie. Sweeite. Careful.
-Watch out, cupcake.
Ho ho.
Watch where you are going.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'm sorry I can't remember right.
Sweetie. Sweeite.
You don't need to be sorry.
You know what you need to do?
Just, keep swimming.
-Yeah.
And I bet you can
remember that because...
We just... We're gonna...
We're gonna sing a song about it.
Just keep swimming.
-Just keep swimming.
Swimming.
-Swimming.
What do we do? We swim.
-What do we do? We swim.
Swim.
-Swim.
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.
Huh!
My parents taught me that song!
We sang it as a family.
All this time I thought I made it up.
What song?
-Just keep swimming.
Hank.
We... just got to keep swimming.
What?
No way!
Listen to me.
It's too dangerous to move.
No, you listen to me.
I know you're scared.
But you can't give up.
Follow me.
Just keep swimming.
Just keep swimming.
Ahhh!
My mom wrote this song for me.
It's gonna get us out of here.
Sing with me, Hank.
Come on.
I'm coming Mommy.
I'm coming Daddy.
Stop.
-Huh?
Turn back.
-Turn back.
You are heading right for poker's cove.
-You are heading right for poker's cove.
Poker's cove.
-Poker's cove.
Poker's cove?
-Incoming!
What is it?
Sorry.
-That's okay.
Everybody does it.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Hank?
Oh, Hank.
There you are.
Wow.
You got us out of there.
Huh.
I did.
I got us out of there.
I mean technically,
you also got us in there.
But, if you hadn't, I'm not sure
we would have gotten... here.
Echolocation.
Echolocation.
Huh!
The world's most powerful pair of glasses.
We found it.
No, no, no.
You found that.
Welcome to the open ocean.
Home.
OOrroo.
Oorroo Oorroo.
Oorroo.
Dad, stop.
She's not coming back.
She might.
Oorroo.
Dad. You made her feel
like she couldn't do it.
You're not talking about Becky,
are you?
I missed Dory.
Me too.
The truth is I'm just
so worried about her.
She's the one that should be
worried about us.
Well, she would definitely have
an idea what to do if she were here.
I don't know how she does that?
-I don't think she knows, Dad.
She just... does.
Then we'll just have to think.
What would Dory do?
-What would Dory do?
Yeah!
What would Dory do?
She would access her situation.
And she would evaluate.
And she would analyze her options.
Dad, that's what would Marlin do.
Right, that's what I would do.
She wouldn't even think twice.
She would just look at the
first thing she sees and...
That was awesome.
Dory would do it.
Nemo, hold on to me.
Hey, it's working!
Just keep gasping.
Are you okay?
-Yeah.
What would Dory do now?
-Who's Dory?
Oh boy.
Are we happy to see you.
Happy to see me?
I'm happy to see you!
I haven't had anyone
to talk to in years.
Years, wow.
Well, unfortunately we can't stay long,
we have to go because we...
Now why would you want to go?
You just landed.
Stay a while.
Tell me all about yourself.
Well I would love to, but my son
and I have to get to quarantine so...
Wonderful thing to have a son.
-Ah yeah, it is.
Of course I don't have a family.
I dated a nice scallop for a while.
-Well that's fascinating.
But scallops have eyes, she was
looking for something different.
I'm kidding, well not about
scallops having eyes, they do.
And they see into your soul
and they break your heart.
Oh Shelley.
Why! Why!
Now what would Dory do?
Come with us, as we explore the
mysterious world of the open ocean.
Okay, follow me.
You're in a cup.
-Right, I'll follow you then.
Wait.
An octopus has three hearts.
Huh, that's a fun fact.
We're-We're here.
This is-This is really happening.
-Shh.
Well.
Looks like this is it, kid.
Now, I got a truck to catch.
-Wait. Wait.
I had something for you.
Tag.
-The tag, right.
You know.
I think I'm going to remember you.
Ah.
You'll forget me in a heartbeat, kid.
Three heartbeats.
I'll have a hard time
forgetting you though.
My parents are actually down there.
You okay?
I'm ready.
Yeah.
I think you are.
Whoa oh.
Wow!
Where are they?
Okay.
Okay.
Pardon me.
Uh. Oh.
Hi. Hello. Have you seen
a mom and a dad without me?
Excuse me.
Have you seen a couple?
They are old like you, not old
like you but older than you even.
Okay.
Bye.
Hi. Do you know anyone
who lost a kid?
A long time ago,
that would be me.
I don't know how long ago exact...
Okay, you're in a hurry.
Ho ho.
Watch where you are going.
Sorry.
Huh!
It's our goal that every animal
we rescued and cared for
will eventually returned home
to where they belong.
Shells.
And, there we go.
Now, if you ever get lost, Dory.
-You just follow the shells.
I love shells.
Huh!
Follow the shells.
Hey, I live here.
-Yes. Yes, indeed.
Huh! My home!
That's my home!
Mom!
Dad!
Okay, cupcake.
Now count to 10.
1, 2, 3.
Huh!
Youuu're welcome.
Who're you talking to, cupcake?
-My pipe-pal, Destiny.
Mom.
Dad?
Mommy loves purple shells.
Huh!
Mommy?
What's going to happen to her?
-There, there, Jenny.
Oh no. Don't cry, Mommy.
Don't cry.
Do you think she's... that she
can make it on her own, Charlie?
Oh honey.
It will be okay.
Mommy loves purple shells.
Dory!
-Dory?
Dory!
Mommy?
AHHH!!!
Dory!
-Dory!
MOMMY!
DADDY!!!
My parents.
I...
I lost them.
It was my fault.
Where's your tag?
-Huh?
Your tag, it's missing.
Is that why you are
not in quarantine?
Quarantine?
-Yeah!
That's where they took
all the blue tangs.
Isn't that right, Bill?
-Yep.
The blue tangs are getting
their own exhibit in Cleveland.
They'd ship out on a truck
at the crack of dawn.
Must be nice.
-What?
No. No.
My parents are back in quarantine?
They are being shipped to Cleveland.
But I just-I just got here.
I've got to get to them.
They don't know I'm here.
Don't worry, it's easy
to get to quarantine.
You can just go through
the pipes, honey.
Oh, I can't do that.
-Why not?
I'll forget where I'm going.
And I can't be somewhere
where I... have nobody to help me.
Well, then I guess you're stuck here.
Huh.
You're not helping, Bill.
Just go in there if you want to.
You'll be fine.
Oh boy.
Could you uh.
Could you tell me how to
get there, through the pipes?
Sure, honey.
It's 2 lefts and then a right.
Simple.
Okay.
2 lefts and a right.
I can do this.
2 lefts and a right.
Okay.
Don't forget.
2 lefts and a right.
2 lefts and a right.
2 lefts,
and-and a right?
Shoot.
Left and right.
Wait.
Did I already take a left?
Oh no, it's happening.
Okay, hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Which way?
Where am I going?
I can't remember. Okay.
Okay, I'm lost.
This is too hard, I can't remember.
I'm forgetting everything.
I'm going to be
stuck forever in the pipes.
The pipes.
The pipe-pals.
Pipe-pals.
Pipe-pals!
And... Swim, swim, swim.
-Yeah, I don't know about this.
Trust me.
I won't let you hit anything.
Wall.
What's the point!
I'll never learn to get around.
You better.
If you can't do it in here,
you'll never do it
out in the ocean.
Now really focus, okay?
Wall!
Destinyyy.
Dory?
Hellooo.
I'm lost in the pipes and
my parents are departing.
Hang on, Doryyy.
Bailey, you got to use your echolocation.
-You know it's broken.
Just stop it and try the ooo thing
Dory talked about, will you?!
Huh, I don't think I can.
-Don't bail on me, Bailey!
Come on, Bailey.
What did you just tell me, huh?
Really.
Focus.
I feel stupid.
Bailey.
-Sorry.
Hellooo.
-Uh, here.
We're hereee.
Guys.
Guys.
What? What?
What is it?
I'm getting something.
Here we go.
Oh yes.
I can see the quarantine!
Ha ha ha!
This is amazing!
I can see everything!
And I can see you!
He can see youuu.
My life's a rainbow!
Can you see me?
Oh wait.
It doesn't work that way.
-Bailey!
Okay.
Tell Dory to go left.
He says go leeeft.
-Leeeft?
Straight.
-Straiiight.
Straight.
Go right.
-Riiight.
Riiight?
I'm light headed.
Wait.
-What?
I'm picking up something else.
Hold on, let me zoom out.
Huh!
Holy Neptune.
She's not alone.
-What? What is it?
I can't tell but it's coming for her.
-Oh no!
Doryyy, swimmm!
Swim the other wayyy.
-What? Whereee?
What? Where?
-Go right!
Riiight.
No, my right!
Oh no.
She's heading right towards it.
No!
Dory, turn around!
That's great, Dory!
You're heading right towards us.
What?
You want me to go right?
No. No. Not right.
Oh, I can't look.
AHH!
-AHH!
Dory! -Dory!
-Marlin?
Oh my gosh!
-Dory, you're okay!
It's consuming her.
-Dory.
It's eating her alive.
-Oh Dory.
You're okay.
You found me!
How did you find me?
There was a crazy clam.
He wouldn't stop talking.
We just slowly back away from
him and into these pipes.
And then we just
started looking.
Doryyy, I'm sorryyy.
Okay.
What was that?
Hang on, I got to take this.
It's oook.
Sorry for whaaat?
What? You're okayyy?
-Yes!
I found Marlin and Nemooo.
Dad, did you hear that?
Dory really does speak whale.
I heard it.
And it's bringing back
some very bad memories.
So let's get out of here.
I say we... we go this way.
Follow me.
It's time to head home.
Wait, wait, wait. Um. Um.
My parents are here.
They are?
-You found your parents?
Well, not exactly.
No.
I mean, not yet.
But uh, I know where they are.
And I don't know exactly
how to get there.
But I know that...
Well, I'm getting help.
Down to quarantinnne.
-Quarantine, that's it.
Oh, and I met this septopus.
Super cranky but secretly kind of sweet.
And he got me into the exhibit...
The exhibit.
Dory?
Do you think my parents
will want to see me?
What?
Why wouldn't they want to see you?
Because...
I lost them.
Dory.
Your parents are going to be
overjoyed to see you.
They're going to miss
everything about you.
Really?
-Dory.
Do you know how we found you?
-Something about a clam or...
No. No.
-No, an oyster.
Mollusc.
-No.
Something... I don't know.
-No. No clam.
We were having a very hard time.
Until Nemo thought,
"What would Dory do?"
Why would you say that?
Because ever since I've met you,
you showed me how to do
stuff I never dream of doing.
Crazy things.
Outsmarting sharks and
jumping jellyfish.
And finding my son.
You made all that happened.
Really?
I didn't know you thought that.
Unless I forgot.
No, you didn't forget.
I never told you.
And I'm sorry about that.
But Dory,
because of who you are
you are about to find
your parents.
And when you do that.
You...
You'll be home.
Dad?
Does this mean we have
to say goodbye to Dory?
Yes, Nemo.
We do.
Hey! So how much more
we got left to load?
Uh, just this last row.
The sooner we finish.
The sooner this truck gets to Cleveland.
TL59
-Watch the turn. -Watch what?
Ow!
-Too late.
Okay, I think we're close.
Hi!
-Hi!
Is this quarantine?
-Yes, this is it.
We're in quarantine.
My parents are here!
Yay!
-Yay!
Where are we going?
Hey, no no no.
Why are we going
towards the door?
We are all better!
Yay!
-I feel fantastic!
Ahchoo!
Dude.
Huh!
My family.
Come on, let's go.
Excuse me.
-Dory, wait a minute!
I'm coming, Mommy!
I'm coming, Daddy!
Woo-hoo!
Almost home.
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.
I heard footsteps.
Huh! Hank!
-Quiet.
Hank, we need to
get in that tank.
Huh! That rhyme.
-Why?
Her parents are there.
Oh.
Look.
You got 3 minutes to get
everyone in this cup with you.
And then I'm on
that truck to Cleveland.
Got it?
-Got it.
Oh boy.
Mom?
Dad?
Hey, everybody.
It's me, Dory.
Dory?
Mom?
Dad?
Mom?
Dad?
She should just pick two
and let's go.
Dad.
-What?
I'm kidding.
It's a reunion.
Mom?
Dad?
Where are my parents?
Dory?
Are you really Jenny
and Charlie's girl?
Yes, I am.
That's me.
Where are they?
Well, Dory.
Right after you disappeared.
They thought you...
Well, they thought you must have
ended up here, in quarantine.
Uh-huh.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
And.
So they came here.
To look for you?
-They're here!
Where are they?
Dory, that was years ago.
-Huh?
They never came back.
Oh no.
You see, Dory.
When fish don't come back
from quarantine, it means.
They're not...
-What?
Dory, they're gone.
Huh!
They're... dead?
They wanted to find you.
-Wait, are you sure?
Are you sure they're gone?
Dory, listen.
It's going to be okay.
Oh Dory,
they loved you so much.
Anyone not looking to go
to Cleveland, final warning.
Dory, are you alright?
-Are you okay?
I was too late.
-Dory, no.
Now listen.
-I don't have a family.
No, Dory.
That's not true.
Time to go!
I'm-I'm all alone.
Dory.
-Dory!
Where's everybody else?
Your orange friends are
on their way to Cleveland.
Gotcha.
I found the octopus.
Aw!
Where did he go?
Huh!
Mommy?
Daddy?
No. No.
No.
Help.
Help me.
Help.
Help me, please.
Somebody help me!
Hey, can...
Help me.
Can you help me.
I've lost them.
-Oh.
I...
-Lost who?
I...
I...
Sorry, honey.
I can't help you if
you don't remember.
Huh!
Oh.
Hey, can you help me?
I've lost... them.
-Uh, can you be more specific?
My. My them.
Them. Them.
Help.
Help.
Please.
They're gone!
Lost.
I've lost everyone.
There's nothing I can do.
Shoot, I can't forget.
What was I forgetting?
Something.
Something important.
Wh...
What was it?
I...
What was it?
It's going away.
It's going away.
It's going because
all I can do is forget.
I just forget
and I forget.
It's what I do best.
It's what I do.
What do I do?
What do I do?
What would Dory do?
I would look around.
And um,
it's just water over there.
And a lot of kelp over here.
Kelp is better, okay.
Now what?
Lots of kelp, looks the same.
They all look the same
except there's a rock.
Over there,
and some sand... this way.
I like sand.
Sand is squishy.
This isn't going anywhere.
There's nothing here.
Nothing but kelp.
Lots of kelp and
some shells.
This... way.
I like shells.
I like... shells.
Whoa!
Hello.
I'm...
Dory!
-Dory!
Look at you.
Oh, my baby.
-I believe you.
I mean, look at you.
-You found us.
I'm never letting you go again.
-My missing girl, you are here.
It's you.
-Yes.
Really you.
-Oh, absolutely.
Mom, you're actually here.
You're...
I am.
And Dad, so are you.
-I'm right here, cupcake.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey.
-What?
Oh, honey.
No, no, no, cupcake.
I know I've got a problem.
I know I'm...
And I'm so sorry that all this
time and I want to fix it.
And I can't. And I try I try.
-Oh, Dory.
But my thoughts, they leave my head.
And ideas changed and...
I've forgotten you
and I'm so sorry.
Dory, Dory, Dory.
Don't you dare be sorry.
Look.
Look what you did.
What?
You found us!
-That's right, you found us.
Honey.
Honey.
Why do you think we
stay put here all these years?
Because we believe one day
you'd find us again.
-Exactly!
But.
I thought you were gone.
How did you?
We went into quarantine
to look for you.
But you weren't there.
And we knew you must have
gotten out through the pipes.
Through the pipes.
That's right, sweetie.
So.
-So, we did too.
And we stayed, in this spot
for you ever since.
Because-Because we thought
you might come back.
So everyday, we go out
and lay out...
Shells.
And you found us.
Oh honey.
You found us.
And you know why you found us
because you remembered.
You remembered in your own
amazing Dory way.
I did.
All by myself.
-Oh honey, really?
Have you been by yourself
all these years?
Oh my poor little girl.
Oh, I haven't been all by myself.
Huh!
Marlin and Nemo!
Nobody saw where Dory went?
No.
-No.
Seriously?
That's a lot of eyeballs doing nothing.
Oh oh oh. Excuse me.
Can you help us.
We're look...
-Me? Help you?
Ahchoo!
Huh! Dad, look!
It's Dory!
Oh, thank goodness.
See, Nemo.
I knew she'd find a way... What?
Hey, where's Dory?
Is she with you?
Huh!
I'm sorry.
I tried to hold on
but I couldn't and...
I lost her.
-What?
Alright.
Let's get going.
NOOOO!
And then, the whale swallowed us,
even though I speak whale.
A whale?
-Good thing I wasn't there to see that.
Actually, Marlin never believes that
I even know how to speak whale.
But, you know what?
He always kind of trust me anyway.
You know.
I like this Marlin already.
Yeah, and then somehow
we found Nemo.
Or did he find me?
I don't know.
But, you now what?
Nemo is the sweetest.
He just never gives up
on me no matter what.
Um.
What would Dory do?
Okay. We'll go this way.
-Well. We'll certainly have to thank...
Wait.
Wait, I know this place.
Hello.
-Huh!
I'm Sigourney Weaver.
-There!
Won't you please join us.
-That's the Marine Life Institute.
Oh, you were born there.
-Dory, is that where your friends are?
Yes, they were stuck in...
in something.
They were-They were going...
somewhere.
Huh, a truck.
They're in the truck.
That means I can... huh!
Never see them again.
No.
No no no.
What would Dory do?
What would Dory do?
I know they are good friends of yours.
But a truck is kind of a tall order.
Yeah. You mother's right, Dory.
-Please! Please!
All I know is that I... missed them.
I... I...
I really-I really missed them.
I've said that before.
Um.
Dory.
Mom.
Marlin and Nemo are
more than good friends.
They're...
They're family.
And I have to
get them back.
See. When they found me,
it felt like fate.
Do you know what I mean?
Or...
What's another word for fate.
Like.
Destiny.
Destiny!
Destinyyy!
Dory?
-Destinyyy.
Morning, Destiny.
-Shh shh shh, shush.
It's Dory.
Something's wrong.
I got her!
She's right outside the institute.
Destiny!
We got to jump.
-Jump?
No time to argue!
Destinyyy.
-Dory. Dory.
The truck thing with
your friends is leaving.
Oh no! That's bad.
-No no no no.
What do we do?
-Destinyyy!
Alright.
-Yeah.
Here we go.
-Yes.
One.
-Yes.
Two.
-I CAN'T!
I can't do it!
I'll never make it out there!
Destiny!
-Huh?
I got the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.
You got the world's most
powerful pair of glasses.
I will be your eyes.
-You're going to be my eyes.
But-But the walls!
-There are no walls in the ocean.
No walls?
It's your destiny, Destiny.
Well, why didn't you say so!
-What? No, Destiny.
Wait.
NO, that's a wall!
WALL!
Mom, Dad.
This is my pipe-pal, Destiny.
Say hi.
Dory.
Are these little blue blobs your parents?
They look just like you.
Hello, I'm Bailey.
Mrs. Dory, Mr. Dory.
Oh please, call me Jenny.
-Oh, I'm-I'm Charlie.
Okay, okay, we got to go.
We got to stop that truck.
Okay.
What truck?
Huh!
Bailey, status report.
Oh yes!
My beautiful gift!
Found it!
The truck's merging onto the
freeway, it's heading south.
Let's go.
We are stopping that truck.
This, I got to see.
-Yeah, yeah, me too.
Oh boy, this is going to be good.
Huh! What the?
Gerald?!
Have you lost your marbles?
-Don't get used to it, Gerald!
Cheeky Joe, that one.
Bailey, I forgot everything,
catch me up.
Yes, ma'am.
Your friends are still
on the truck.
They're heading north
towards the bridge.
Oh look.
There's a bunch of
cute otters over there.
I want one.
Ow!
-Ahh!
Ow!
Bailey!
Oh oh oh.
I see the truck!
It's over there!
I don't see how
we can get on it, Dory.
Oh man, if only there was
a way to stop traffic.
Stop traffic.
Stop traffic.
Everyone needs to stop.
People stop to look at things.
Things that they like.
Things that are cute.
Huh!
Things that are cute!
Okay, I got it.
-What? What is it?
Quickly before I forget.
Destiny, when the truck reaches the bridge,
you flip me up there.
-Got it.
You guys.
Follow me.
Everyone else, stay here.
-Whoa. Whoa.
Dory, honey.
You're not leaving us again.
Your mother is right.
You have to stay with us.
Dory, sweetie.
What happens if...
You know, if you're gone for...
-Mom.
I don't know, too long and...
-Mom.
What if you get confused.
-Mom.
And that makes you distracted.
And what if...
I lose you again?
Yes.
Mom, Dad.
It's going to be okay.
Because,
I know that even if I forget.
I can find you again.
Okay, a little left.
Back the other way a bit.
Okay, that's it.
Yo. Don't do it.
-Bailey!
Okay. Now, now!
Do it! Do it!
Time for your idea.
-Okay. What idea?
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
What do I do? What do I do?
What would Dory do?
Come on, cars.
Cars, I see cars.
Otters in front of cars.
Car have to stop.
Stop traffic!
Cuddle party!
Look out!
They're so cute!
-Aww.
Look at them.
There must be, 1, 2, 3...
What's going on, Dad?
I don't know how.
I don't know in what way.
But I think this has
something to do with...
Dory!
-Dory!
Water. Water.
I need water.
Are you crazy?
How do you get here?
Dory!
-Dory!
I thought we'd
never see you again.
Ah, me too.
But darn it.
No matter how hard I tried,
I just couldn't forget you.
Guess I miss the rest of
my family too much, huh.
We're family?
-Mm-hm.
Do you know what
that feels like?
Yes.
I know what that feels like.
Aw!
-Aw!
Hey!
Hey, come on.
Out of the truck.
Those aren't your fish. Shoo.
Oh no.
There goes our ride.
Back in the water, come on.
Doryyy, the traffic is starting to mooove.
Leave it to me.
I got this.
Becky.
Becky, come back!
We need your help, Becky!
Wahh!
Dory, follow me.
No, no, wait.
We don't have Dory!
No, no, Becky.
Wait. Stop.
We need to go back.
Becky.
Back, back, Becky.
Ahh!
Please don't eat us!
Where's Dory?
-Who are you?
Jenny?
-Marlin?
Charlie?
-Nemo?
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
-Thank you for taking care of our Dory.
Dory!
She's still in the truck!
Becky!
Back to Dory!
Oorroo Dory!
Okay, kid.
I guess this is goodbye.
No.
-What do you mean, no?
I mean, you're not
going to the Cleveland.
You are coming to
the ocean with me.
What is it with you
and ruining my plans.
Listen to me.
I have one goal in life.
One. And it is to...
-No, you listen to me.
What is so great about plans?
I never had a plan.
Did I plan to lose my parents?
No.
Did I plan to find Marlin?
No.
Did you and I plan to meet?
Wait, did we?
-Are you almost done?
Well, I don't think we did.
And that's because the best things
happened by chance.
Because that's life.
And that's you being with me,
out in the ocean.
Not safe in some
stupid glass box.
Can I say something?
-I'm not done!
A friend of mine,
her name's Sigourney,
once told me that all
it takes is 3 simple steps.
Rescue, rehabilitation and
one other thing, that is...
Release!
-Release!
Yay!
-Yay!
That's right.
So, what do you say?
Release!
-Release!
Release!
-Release!
I was going to say, okay.
Not good.
Oh, no, no.
-Where are they going?
Charlie, they are going away.
-What do we do?
Quick, guys, grab my fin.
He's trying to get
the door open
It's locked from the outside!
Come on, Dory.
You can do it!
Destiny.
Destiny!
Wall! Wall! Wall!
-Whoa!
Oh no.
-Oh no.
Dory!
No, wait!
Dory!
-Dory!
Bailey, where are they heading?
I'm losing them!
Dory.
It's over.
No. There's-There's...
There's got to be away.
Yeah.
-Yeah.
Dory, now listen to me.
There's no way to get out.
But, there's got to be a way.
There's always a way.
There isn't, Dory.
I'm telling you,
this time there's
no other way!
Well, what about that?
Holy carp.
There is another way.
Take a deep breath, kid.
Release!
-Release!
Ahchoo!
Excuse me.
Release!
-Release!
What is that?
-I don't care! Just get it off!
What?
-What the?
Suck it, bipeds.
Alright, Hank.
You got 7 arms.
I don't know.
Just try something.
Okay.
Here we go!
Huh?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop!
What?
Oh.
That's doing something.
-And we are moving.
Good job, Hank.
-Wait. Wait. Wait.
Hey!
-Come on!
Wait.
Wait.
Listen, I'm not trying
to tell you how to drive,
certainly I can't...
I'm not in any position.
But could you...
could you go faster?
Hey, slow...
Hey!
Give us our truck back!
I can't see squat!
Which way are we going?
Okay.
Well...
All the cars are going left.
So-So, go left.
Gilman Street.
Ashby Avenue.
Oh, Gilman street... again.
Huh, Gilman street again.
How much longer are
we going to veer left?
It's okay.
We just need to
know how we got on.
And then we'll know
how to get off.
Well, let me know
when you figured it out.
Unfortunately I can't remember
how we got on.
Huh!
Hey, I know those guys.
That's where we came from.
Turn right.
Here we go!
Hey, hey, hey!
-Wahh!
Whoa!
-Whoa!
HEY!
We are so fired.
Keep straight, straight.
Left. Left.
No, no, no, no.
Right. Right. Right.
Good driving, Hank.
-Pay attention to the road.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh oh. Fork in the road.
Which way?
-Uh.
Ocean. Ocean.
Hey, a boat!
You know, I have had great
experiences with boats but...
Which way!
-Uh.
Huh!
Boats go to the ocean!
Right.
-Hold on!
We're out of time, kid.
Where do we go now?
Um. Well, um.
Okay, I'll figure it out.
I don't-I don't know.
But, well.
Something will come and...
Huh!
Seagulls!
Hank, follow those birds.
The ocean is left, Hank.
Hold on.
I'm getting something.
Is it them?
Is everything perfect?
Oh oh, it's the fuzz.
Busted.
Okay, we're good.
Huh, the ocean.
It's straight ahead, floor it.
-Now we're talking.
Oh. Oh oh.
-What do you mean, oh oh?
Oh no.
What would I do?
What would I do? What would I do?
What would I do?
Hank, I'm gonna ask you
to do something crazy.
I'm okay with crazy.
Alright, Hank.
There's no way out!
It's over!
They are going to fish jail!
Wait.
Oh no.
Get back!
Get back...
AHH!
-AHH!
I see trees of green,
red roses too.
I see them bloom,
for me and you.
Free!
-Free!
Dory!
What lies before you represents
the third and final part
of the marine life mission.
Rescue, rehabilitation and release.
Come to Papa.
I'm Sigourney Weaver.
Thank you for joining me.
1, 2, 3, 4.
Uh... Wait a minute.
Why am I counting?
Hey, where's everyone?
Oh oh, did...
Did they leave me?
No. No no.
They wouldn't do that.
Okay, that's okay.
I can figure this out.
What was I just doing then?
I was um...
I was covering my face.
So I was trying to hide.
Okay.
So why was I trying to hide?
Wait, huh!
Oh, I'm...
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Ready or not, here I come!
Ah ha, found you.
I see you.
-Oh.
Ha ha!
Gotcha.
Alright, you little shrimps,
recess is over.
Oh man.
-Ha! Nobody found me.
Bring it in.
Bring it in.
Time for another...
Don't touch me.
Time for another lesson.
When is Mr. Ray coming back
from his migration?
If he is smart, he'll stay away
from here as long as he can.
But until he does,
I'm your substitute teacher.
Okay, kids.
Who wants to learn about echolocation?
Nobody.
Okay, cupcake.
Have fun.
Nice day for a swim, huh?
Alright.
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.
Well.
I guess we'll go back home and...
brush up on the anemone.
You coming, Dory?
Me? Oh.
I'm just going to the drop-off.
Oh.
Okay.
What?
The drop-off?
NO!
That's-That's-That's a good idea?
Yeah.
I just thought
I go enjoy the view.
Bye bye.
The view.
Well, you have a good time.
All by yourself.
Not.
Not getting... lost.
Oh.
Huh?
No no no...
Dory.
Dory.
Dory.
Hey, Marlin.
-Oh, hey.
Hello, Dory.
You alright?
You looked worried.
No, no, no.
I'm-I'm fine.
It's how I always look.
What?
Well, I just...
You did it.
Huh!
Yay!
-You did it, cupcake.
Yes!
-Did what?
Sweetie.
You just followed the shells
all the way back home.
Huh!
Oh my gosh, I did?
All by myself?
-Yeah.
Do you know what
this means, honey?
It means.
You can do whatever
you put your mind to, Dory.
Really?
Look at us go!
Huh!
Mommy, can I go play with them?
Yeah.
-Absolutely!
Go get them, cupcake.
Yeah.
I did it.
Hm.
Hm.
It really is quite a view.
Yep.
Unforgettable.


Fear, treachery, blood lust.
Thousands of years ago
these were the...
forces that ruled our world
A world where prey were
scared of predators.
And predators had an
uncontrollable...
biological urge to maim, and maul, and...
Awww!
Blood! Blood! Blood!
Ahhh...
Back then, the world
was divided in two.
Vicious predator,
or meek prey.
But over time, we evolved,
and moved beyond or primitive savage ways.
Now predator and prey
live in harmony.
And every young mammal
has multitudinous opportunities.
Yeah, I don't have to cower
in a a herd anymore.
Instead, I can be an astronaut.
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.
I'm gonna be an actuary.
And I can make the world a better place.
I am going to be...
A police officer!
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard!
It may seem impossible to small minds.
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.
But, just 211 miles away,
stands the great city of Zootopia.
Where our ancestors first joined
together in peace.
And declared that anyone
can be anything!
Thank you and good night.
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?
Nope
Well, we gave up on our dreams,
and we settled. Right, Bon?
Oh, yes. That's right, Stu.
We settled hard.
You see, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.
If you don't try anything
new, you'll never fail.
I like trying, actually.
What your father means, hon, is that it's
gonna be difficult, impossible even...
- for you to become a police officer.
- Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
- No.
- Bunnies don't do that.
- Never.
- Never.
Well... Then I guess
I'll have to be the first one.
Because I am gonna make
the world a better place!
Or, heck, you know. You wanna talk
about making the world a better place,
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.
Yes! Your dad, me,
your 275 brothers and sisters.
- We're changing the world.
- Yeah.
- One carrot at a time.
- Amen to that.
Carrot farming is a noble profession.
You get it, honey?
I mean, it's great to have dreams.
Yeah, just as long as you
don't believe in them too much.
Where the heck'd she go?
Give me your tickets right now,
or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.
Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!
Baah, baah!
What are you gonna do, cry?
- Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.
- Nice costume, loser.
What crazy world are you living in
where you think a bunny could be a cop?
- Kindly return my friend's tickets.
- Come and get them. But watch out.
Cause I'm a fox, and like you said
in your dumb little stage play,
us predators used to eat prey.
And that killer instinct's still in our denna.
- Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA.
- Don't tell me what I know, Travis.
You don't scare me, Gideon.
Scared now?
Look at her nose twitch,
she is scared.
Cry, little baby bunny!
Cry... Ow...
Oh, you don't know
when to quit, do you?
Huh!
I want you to remember this moment
the next time you think you will ever be...
anything more than just a
stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.
- That looks bad.
- Are you okay, Judy?
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Here you go.
- Wow, you got our tickets!
- You're awesome, Judy.
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know
what he's talking about!
Well, he was right
about one thing.
I don't know when to quit.
ZOOTOPIA POLICE ACADEMY
Listen up, cadets. Zootopia has 12
unique ecosystems within its city limits.
Tundratown, Sahara Square,
Rainforest District, to name a few.
You're gonna have to master all of
them before you hit the streets.
Or guess what?
You'll be dead!
Scorching sandstorm.
You're dead, bunny bumpkin.
One thousand foot fall.
You're dead, carrot baby.
Frigid ice wall.
You're dead, farm girl.
Enormous criminal.
You're dead.
Dead.
Dead.
Dead.
Ohhh...!
Filthy toilet.
You're dead, fluffy butt.
Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny.
- There's never been a bunny cop. Never.
- Just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.
As mayor of Zootopia, I am proud
to announce that my mammal inclusion...
initiative, has produced its first
police academy graduate.
Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...
Judy Hopps.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.
- Oh, yes, yes!
- Thank you.
Judy, it is my great privilege to officially
assign you to the heart of Zootopia...
Precinct One.
City Center.
- Yeh!
- Yeh!
Congratulations Officer Hopps.
I won't let you down.
This has been my dream
since I was a kid.
You know, it's a real proud
day for us little guys.
Bellwether, make room, will you?
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!
Officer Hopps, look here.
- We're real proud of you, Judy.
- Yeah, and scared too.
- Yes.
- Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.
I mean, Zootopia.
So far away, such a big city.
Guys, I've been working for this
my whole life.
We know. And we're just a little
exited for you, but terrified.
The only thing we have to
fear is fear itself.
And also bears. We have
bears to fear, too.
- Say nothing on lions, and wolves.
- Wolves?
- Weasels.
- You played cribbage with a weasel once?
Yeah, he cheats like
there's no tomorrow.
You know what?
Pretty much all predators.
- And Zootopia is full of them.
- Oh, Stu.
And foxes are the worst.
Yeah, actually, your father
does have a point there.
It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?
When I was nine. Gideon Grey was
a jerk who happens to be a fox.
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.
Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely.
But just in case,
we made you a little
care package to take with you.
- I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.
- Yeah, it's safe to have that.
- This is fox repellant.
The deterrent and the
repellant, that's all she needs.
- Check this out!
- Oh, for goodness sake!
She has no need for
a fox taser, Stu.
Oh, come on.
When is there not need a for a fox taser?
Well, okay, look, I will take this...
To make you stop talking.
Terrific!
Everyone wins!
Arriving, Zootopia Express.
Okay, gotta go.
Bye!
Mmm. I love you, guys.
Love you, too.
- Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.
- Oh, Stu. Pull it together.
Bye everybody!
Bye Judy, I love you!
Bye!
Bye!
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING
BUNNYBURROW.
I'm Gazelle.
Welcome to Zootopia.
And welcome to the crime family house.
Luxury apartments with charm.
Complementary delousing once a month.
Don't lose your key!
Thank you.
- Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor!
- Yeah? Well, we're loud.
Don't expect us to apologize for it.
Greasy walls.
Rickety bed.
Crazy neighbors.
I love it!
Come on!
He bared his teeth first!
- Excuse me!
- Hmm?
Down here!
- Hi.
- O... M... Goodness!
They really did hire a bunny.
Ho-whop! I gotta tell you,
you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.
Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know,
but a bunny can call another bunny 'cute',
but when other animals
do it, that's a little...
Ohhh. I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser.
The guy everyone thinks is just
a flabby donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.
- Oh.
- No, it's okay.
Oh. You've actually got...
there's a...
- A what?
- In your neck. The fold.
- The... this...
- Oh, there you went, you little dickens!
Hehehe, I should get to roll call,
so which way do I...
- Oh, ball pen's over there to the left.
- Great. Thank you!
Oh... That poor little bunny's gonna
get eaten alive.
Hey! Officer Hopps.
You ready to make the world a better place?
Attention!
All right. All right.
Everybody sit.
I've got three items
on the docket.
First, we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.
Francine.
Happy birthday.
Oh.
Number two. There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce,
but I'm not going to because...
I don't care.
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.
All predators. From a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.
And City Hall is right up
my tail to find them.
This is priority number one.
Assignments.
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.
Your team take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.
Officers McHorn, Ryan Spitz, Wolfard.
Your teams take Sahara Square.
Officers Higgins, Snorlof, Trunkaby.
Tundratown.
And finally, our first bunny,
Officer Hopps.
Parking duty.
Dismissed.
Parking duty?
Chief?
Chief Bogo?
Sir. You said there were
fourteen missing mammal cases.
- So?
- So I can handle one.
You probably forgot but, I was
top of my class at the academy.
Didn't forget.
Just don't care.
Sir, I'm not just
some token bunny.
Well then, writing a hundred
tickets a day should be easy.
A 100 tickets. I'm not
gonna write 100 tickets.
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.
Before noon.
(EXPIRED)
(EXPIRED)
Ah!
Boom!
Two hundred tickets before noon!
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!
Huh!
Hmm.
Where'd he go?
Listen. I know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours,
but I don't want any
trouble in here. So hit the road!
I'm not looking for
any trouble either, sir...
I simply wanna buy a Jumbo-Pop.
For my little boy.
You want the red,
or the blue, pal?
Oh.
I'm such a...
- Oh, come on, kid. Back up. Listen, buddy.
- What?
There aren't any fox ice cream joints
in your part of town?
No, no. There are, there are.
It's just, my boy,
this goofy little stinker,
he loves all things elephant.
He wants to be one
when he grows up.
Isn't that adorable?
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams, huh? Right?
Look, you probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says
"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone!"
So beat it.
You're holding up the line.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
turn like everyone else, meter maid.
Actually, I'm an officer.
Just have a quick question.
Are your customers
aware they're getting
snot and mucus with
their cookies and cream?
What are you talking about?
Well. I don't wanna
cause you any trouble,
but I believe scooping ice cream with an
ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation.
Which is kind of a big deal.
Of course I could let you off with
a warning if you were to glove those trunks
and... I don't know...
finish selling this...
nice dad and his son a...
What was it?
A Jumbo-Pop.
Please.
A Jumbo-Pop.
- $15.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
Oh no, are you kidding me...
I don't have my wallet!
I'd lose my head if it
weren't attached to my neck.
That's the truth. Oh, boy.
I'm sorry, pal.
Gotta be about the
worst birthday ever.
Please don't be mad at me.
Thanks anyway.
Keep the change.
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind. Really. Can I pay you back?
Oh, no.
My treat.
It's just, you know it burns me up to see folks
with such backward attitudes towards foxes.
I just want to say you're a great
dad and just a real articulate fella.
Oh.
Well, that is high praise.
It's rare that I find
someone so non-patronizing.
- Officer?
- Hopps. Mr..?
Wilde.
Nick Wilde.
And you, little guy. You wanna
be an elephant when you grow up?
You be an elephant.
Because this is Zootopia.
Anyone can be anything.
Ahh.
I tell him that all the time.
All right, here you go.
Two paws.
Yeah. Oh, look at that smile,
that's a happy birthday smile!
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.
Toot-toot.
- Bye, now!
- Goodbye!
Oh.
Hey, little toot-toot...
"ORGANIC" $2
PAWPSICLE
"ORGANIC " $2
BANCO
BROTHERS
LEMMING
Get your Pawpsicles.
Oh!
- Lumber delivery.
- What's with the color?
The color?
Uh... it's red wood.
39, 40, there you go.
Way to work that diaper, big guy.
Hey. No kiss
bye-bye for daddy?
You kiss me tomorrow,
I'll bite your face off!
Ciao.
Well, I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.
You liar!
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar. He is.
Hey!
All right, Slick-Nick.
You're under arrest.
Really?
For what?
Gee, I don't know. How about
selling food without a permit?
Transporting undeclared commerce across lines?
- False advertizing.
- Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.
And I didn't falsely
advertize anything. Take care.
You told that mouse the
pawpsicle sticks were redwood!
That's right. Red wood.
With a space in the middle.
Wood that is red.
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.
You're gonna wanna refrain
from calling me Carrots.
My bad. I just naturally
assumed you came...
from some little carrot-choked Podunk.
No?
Uh, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke county
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.
Okay.
Tell me if this story sounds familiar.
Naive little hick with good
grades and big ideas decides
'Hey, look at me, I'm
gonna move to Zootopia...
Where predators and prey live
in harmony and sing Kumbaya!'
Only to find, whoopsie,
we don't all get along.
And that dream of becoming a big city cop,
double whoopsie, she's a meter maid.
And whoopsie number three-sie,
no one cares about her or her dreams.
And soon enough those dreams die, and our
bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor
living in a box under a bridge. Till finally she has no choice but to go
back home
with that cute fuzzy wuzzy little tail
between her legs to become...
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?
So how about a carrot farmer?
That sound about right?
Oh!
Be careful now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.
Hey, hey. No one tells me what I can
or can't be. Especially not some...
jerk who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler.
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia thinking
they can be anything they want.
Well, you can't.
You can only be what you are.
Sly fox.
Dumb bunny.
I'm not a dumb bunny.
Right.
And that's not wet cement.
You'll never be a real cop.
You're a cute meter maid, though.
Maybe a supervisor one day.
Hang in there.
Mom & Dad
- Oh, hey, it's my parents!
- Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart!
Hey there, Jude the Dude.
How was your first day on the force?
- It was real great!
- Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?
Absolutely. And more.
Everyone's so nice, and I feel like...
- I'm really making a difference.
- Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bon.
- Look at that!
- Oh, my sweet heaven!
Judy, are you a meter maid?
Oh, this.. No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing..
- It's the safest job on the force!
- She's not a real cop!
- Our prayers have been answered!
- Glorious day!
Ho-ho, meter maid,
meter maid, meter maid!
- Dad! Dad!
- Meter maid!
You know what,
it's been a really long day, I should...
- You get some rest.
- Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Hey, bunny!
Turn down that depressing music!
Leave the meter maid alone,
didn't you hear her conversation?
- She feels like a failure!
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!
- You shut up!
- You shut up!
- Tomorrow is another day.
Yeah, but it might be worse!
I was 30 seconds over!
Yeah, you're a real hero, lady.
My mommy says
she wishes you were dead.
How glory are that my tax dollars
pay your salary.
I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.
Hey, you!
Bunny!
Sir, if you have a grievance you may
contest recitation in traffic court.
What are you talking about?!
My shop!
It was just robbed!
Look, he's getting away!
Well, are you a cop or not?
Oh! Yes! Yes!
Don't worry, sir, I got this!
- Stop in the name of the law!
- Catch me if ya' can, cottontail!
Coming through!
This is officer McHorn.
We got a 10-31.
I got dibs!
Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit!
Woo-hoo!
LITTLE
RODENTIA
- Ah!
- Ahh!
Ha ha ha.
You!
Hey!
Hey, meter maid!
Wait for the real cops!
Stop!
Ahhhh!
Oh.
Sorry! Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.
Yahhh!
Bon voyage, flatfoot!
Huh!
- Hey! Stop right there!
- Have a donut, coppa!
Oh my god, did you see those
leopard print jeggings?
- Ah!
- Ah!
Oh!
- I love your hair.
- Thank you.
Heheheheh.
Come to papa!
Okay. You're gonna have
to be patient and wait in line
just like everyone else,
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?
- I popped the weasel!
- Hopps!
Abandoning your post. Inciting a scurry.
Reckless endangerment of rodents...
But, to be fair, you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.
Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.
Those are pest riddance called
Midnicampum holicithias.
They're a class C botanical, sir.
Well, I grew up in a family where plant
husbandry was kind of a thing...
- Shut your tiny mouth now!
- Sir, I got the bad guy.
That's my job.
Your job is putting tickets
on parked cars!
Chief, Mrs. Otterton's
here to see you again.
- Not now.
- Okay, I just need to know if you want to...
- take it this time she seems really upset...
- Not now!
Sir. I don't wanna
be a meter maid,
I wanna be a real cop.
Do you think the mayor
asked what I wanted...
- when he assigned you to me?
- But, sir...
Life isn't some cartoon musical where you
sing a little song, and your insipid dreams...
magically come true!
So let it go.
Chief Bogo, please!
Five minutes of your time, please.
I'm sorry sir. I tried to stop her,
she's super slippery.
I gotta go sit down.
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.
My husband has been
missing for ten days.
- His name is Emmitt Otterton.
- Yes. I know.
He's a florist.
We have 2 beautiful children.
He would never just disappear.
Ma'am, our detectives
are very busy.
Please. There's gotta be somebody
to find my Emmitt.
- Mrs. Otterton.
- I will find him.
Oh. Thank you!
Bless you, bless you, little bunny!
Take this.
Find my Emmitt.
Bring him home to me and my babies.
Please.
Mrs. Otterton.
Please wait out here.
Of course.
Oh, thank you both so much!
One second.
- You're fired.
- What? Why?
Insubordination! Now. I'm going to open
this door, and you're goind to tell that Otter
you're a former meter maid with delusion
of grandeur, who will not be taking the case.
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case!
Assistant Mayor Bellwether!
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.
Mayor Lionheart is
just gonna be so thrill!
No, let's not tell
the mayor just yet.
And I sent it, and it is done,
so I did do that.
All right, well, I'd say
the case is in good hands.
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?
- Like glue.
- Good one.
Just call me if you ever
need anything. Okay?
You've always got a friend at
City Hall, Judy. All right! Bye-bye!
Thank you, ma'am!
I will give you 48 hours.
Yes!
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
But.. You strike out, you resign.
Okay. Deal.
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.
Here you go.
One missing otter.
- That's it?
- Yikes!
That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen. Leads, none.
Witnesses, none. And you're not in the
computer system yet, so...
Resources, none!
Ha ha!
Hoo, I hope you didn't stake your
career on cracking this one.
Okay.
Last known sighting.
Can I just borrow?
Thank you.
- Pawpsicle?
- The murder weapon!
- 'Get your pawpsicle'...
- Yeah! Cause that...
What does that mean?
It means I have a lead.
- Hi! Hello! It's me again!
- Hey! It's officer toot-toot.
Hoo...No.
Actually it's Officer Hopps,
and I'm here to ask you some
questions about a case.
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?
It wasn't me.
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby.
I gotta get to work.
This is important, sir. I think your
ten dollars worth of pawpsicles can wait.
Ha! I make 200 bucks
a day, fluff.
365 days a year,
since I was 12.
- And time is money. Hop along.
- Please just look at the picture.
You sold Mr. Otterton that pawpsicle, right?
- Do you know him?
- I know everybody.
And I also know that somewhere
there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal,
so why don't you get back to your box?
Fine.
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.
- Did you just boot my stroller?
- Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.
Ha. For what? Hurting
your feelings?
Felony tax evasion.
Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12...
that's two decades, so times twenty, which is
1,460,000, I think.
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.
Anyway, according to your tax forms,
you reported, let me see here, zero!
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.
- 5 years jail time.
- Well, it's my word against yours.
'200 bucks a day, fluff,
365 days a year, since I was twelve.'
Actually it's your
word against yours.
And if you want this pen
you're going to help me
find this poor missing otter,
or the only place
you'll be selling pawpsicles
is the prison cafeteria.
It's called a hustle, sweet heart.
She hustled you.
Ehahaha...
She hustled you good!
You're a cop now, Nick.
You're gonna need one of these.
Have fun working with the fuzz!
Start talking.
I don't know where he is,
I only saw where he went.
Great, let's go!
It's not exactly a place
for a cute little bunny.
- Don't call me cute, get in the car.
- Okay. You're the boss.
Hi.
I'm...
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
My name is...
You know, I'm gonna hit the
pause button right there.
Cause we're all good on
bunny scout cookies.
Uh, no.
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal...
Emmitt Otterton. Right here.
He may have frequented this establishment?
Yeah, old Emmitt!
Haven't seen him in
a couple of weeks.
But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.
I'd be happy to take you back.
Oh, thank you so much, I'd appericiate
that more than you can imagine, it'd be such...
- Oh! You are naked..
- Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club!
Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything.
These guys, they be naked.
Nangi's just on the other side
of the pleasure pool.
Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.
Yes, there is.
Boy, that's the spirit.
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird.
But you know what I say is weird?
Clothes on animals!
Here we go!
As you can see, Nangi is an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.
Hey, Nangi. These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.
- Who?
- Eh.
Emmitt Otterton. Been coming
to your yoga class for like six years.
I have no memory
of this beaver.
He's an otter, actually.
He was here a couple of
Wednesdays ago. Remember?
No.
Yeah, he was wearing a green
cable knit sweater vest,
and a new pair of Quarterway slacks.
Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.
- Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?
- No.
Yeah, and we both walked him out, and he got into this
big old white car with a silver trim.
Needed a tune up. The third cylinder
wasn't firing. Remeber that, Nangi?
No.
Eh. You didn't happen to catch
the licence plate number?
- Did you?
- Oh, for sure. It was 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
0-3. Wow, this is a lot of great info.
Thank you.
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue.
And seeing as any moron can run a plate,
I will take that pen
and bid you adieu.
The plate.
I can't run a plate.
Oomf.
I'm not in the system yet.
- Give me the pen, please.
- What was it you said?
Any moron can run a plate?
Gosh, if only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.
Rabbit, I did what you asked.
You can't keep me
on the hook forever.
Not forever. Well, I only have 36
hours left to solve this case.
So can you run the plate or not?
Actually, I just remembered,
I have a pal at the DMV.
Flash is the fastest guy in there.
You need something done, he's on it.
I hope so. We are really fighting the clock
and every minute counts.
Wait.
They're all sloths?
You said this was
going to be quick!
What, are you saying just
because he's a sloth
he can't be fast? I thought in
Zootopia anyone could be anything.
Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!
Buddy, it's nice to see you.
Nice to... see you... too.
Hey, Flash, I'd love
you to meet my friend.
Ah...Darlin, I've forgotten your name.
Hmm. Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
How are you?
I am...
doing... just..
- Fine?
- as well.. as.. I can.. be...
- What...
- Hang in there.
- can I... do...
- Well, I was hoping you could run a plate...
- for you...
- Well, I was hoping you could...
...today?
Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us.
We are in a really big hurry.
- Sure... What's the... plate...
- 2-9-T...
- Number?
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
- 2... 9...
- T-H-D-0-3.
- T...
- H-D-0-3.
- H...
- D-0-3.
- D...
- Mm-hm. 0-3.
- 0...
- 3!
- Hey, Flash. Wanna hear a joke?
- No!
- Sure.
- Mmm!
What do you call a
three-humped camel?
I don't know.
What do you call...
- Three-humped camel.
- a three-humped... camel?
Pregnant.
Ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha. Yes, very funny, very funny!
Can we please just focus on the task?
- Hey...
- Wait, wait!
- Priscilla!
- Oh, no!
- Yes... Flash?
- What... do..
- No...
- you call...
A three-humped camel?
- Pregnant! Okay! We got it! Please just...
- - three... humped...
- Here... you...
- Yes! Yeah, yeah! Hurry, thank you!
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
- ...go.
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.
A limo took Otterton! And
the limo's in Tundratown!
It's in Tundratown!
Way to hustle, bud. I love you.
I owe you.
Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour and...
It's night?!
Closed.
Great.
Mm. And I will betcha
you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm?
- Darn it. It's a bummer.
- You wasted the day on purpose.
Ma'am, I have a fake badge. I would never
impede your pretend investigation.
It's not a pretend investigation!
Look, see? See him? This otter is missing.
Well, then they should have
gotten a real cop to find him.
What is your problem? Does
seeing me fail somehow make
you feel better about your
own sad, miserable life?
It does, 100%.
Now, since you're sans warrant.
I guess we're done?
Fine. We are done.
Here's your pen.
First off, you throw like a bunny.
Second, you're a very sore loser.
See you later, Officer Fluff.
So sad this is over.
- I wish I could have helped more.
- The thing is, you don't need...
a warrant if you have probable cause,
and I'm pretty sure I saw a...
shifty lowlife climbing the fence.
So you're helping plenty! Come on!
2-9-T-H-D-0-3!
This is it!
Polar bear fur.
- Oh my God!
- What? What?
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!
But on CD.
Who still uses CDs?
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.
Those are claw marks.
You ever seen anything like this?
- No.
- Oh, wait. Look!
This is him. Emmitt Otterton.
He was definitely here.
What do you think happened?
Oh no, wait a minute.
Polar bear fur...
Rat-pack music. Fancy cup.
I know whose car this is, we gotta go!
- What? Whose car is it?
- The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.
They call him Mr. Big, and he does not
like me. So we gotta go!
I'm not leaving,
this is a crime scene.
Well, it's gonna be an
even bigger crime scene...
if Mr. Big finds me here,
so we're leaving right now.
Raymond! And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.
And speaking of no see,
how about you forget you saw me?
Huh?
For old times sake?
That's a no..
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?
I, uh... I may have sold him
a very expensive wall rug
that was made from the fur
of a skunk's butt.
Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers.
- Is that Mr. Big?
- No.
- What about him? Is that him?
- No.
- That's gotta be him.
- Stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking!
Huh.
Mr. Big, sir,
this is a simple misunder...
Hmmph.
Yeah.
This is a simple misunderstanding.
You come here unannounced on the
day my daughter is to be married.
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...
Point is, I did not know
that it was your car,
and I certainly did not know about
your daughter's wedding!
I trusted you, Nicky.
I welcomed you into my home.
We broke bread together.
Grandmama made you a cannoli.
And how did you repay my generosity?
With a rug
made from the butt of a skunk.
A skunk-butt rug.
You disrespected me.
You disrespected my grandmama,
who I buried in that skunk-butt rug.
I told you never to show your face
here again, but here you are.
Snooping around with this...
What are you? A performer?
What's with the costume?
- Sir, I am a co...
- Mime!
She's a mime.
This mime can not speak.
- You can't speak if you're a mime.
- No, I am a cop.
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.
And my evidence puts him in your car!
So intimidate me all you want,
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter
if it's the last thing I do.
Hmm.
Then I have only one request.
Say hello to Grandmama.
Ice 'em!
No, no, no. I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!
And you never will.
Please!
No, no, no, no!
If you're mad at me about
the rug, I've got more rugs!
Daddy! It's time for our dance!
Ah! What did we say?
No icing anyone at my wedding!
I have to, baby,
daddy has to.
- Ice 'em.
- No, no, no!
Wait, wait!
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!
From that giant donut!
- This bunny?
- Yeah. Hi!
- Hi. I love your dress.
- Oh. Thank you.
Put them down.
You've done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter.
I will take your kindness,
and pay it forward.
Hmm.
Otterton is my florist.
He's like a part of the family.
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.
That's why I sent that
car to pick him up.
But he never arrived.
Because he was attacked.
No, he attacked.
Otterton?
Otterton.
He went crazy.
Ripped up the car.
Scared my driver half to death.
And disappeared into the night.
But he's a sweet little otter.
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down we are still animals.
You wanna find Otterton, talk to
the driver of the car.
His name is Manchas.
Lives in the Rainforest District.
Only he can tell you more.
Mr. Manchas?
Judy Hopps, ZPD.
We just wanna know what happened
to Emmitt Otterton.
You should be asking
what happened to me.
- Whoa. A teensy otter did that?
- What happened?
He was an animal.
Down on all fours.
He was a savage!
There was no warning.
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.
Over and over, the Night Howlers!
So you know about
the Night Howlers too?
Good, good.
Because the Night Howlers are exactly
what we are here
to talk about. Right?
Yes, so you just open the
door and tell us what you know,
and we will tell you what we know.
Okay?
Okay.
Clever fox.
Mr. Manchas?
Are you okay?
Run. Run!
- What is wrong with him?!
- I don't know!
Jump!
Come on!
Head down!
Officer Hopps to dispatch!
Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest
singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns.
Okay, hold on.
Keep watching.
Who's that beside her?
Who is it?
Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!
It's not, it's just a new app.
- Hold on a second.
- Clawhauser!
Clawhauser, listen to me.
We have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!
- Vine and Tujunga!
- It's Tu-hunga!
Okay, we're sending backup!
Look, over there!
Head for the sky-trans!
Get in.
Carrots? Carrots!
Go!
Buddy, one predator to another.
Now I can tell you're a little tense,
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!
Rabbit, whatever you do,
do not let go!
- I'm gonna let go!
- You're gonna to what?
One, two...
Carrots, you saved my life.
Well, that's what we do at the ZPD...
Well, this should be good.
I thought this was just a missing mammal case,
but it's way bigger.
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.
I believe he and this jaguar,
they...
They went savage, sir.
Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps.
Animals don't go savage.
I thought so too.
Till I saw this.
What?
He was right here!
The savage jaguar?
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!
Or maybe any agressive predator
looks savage to rabbits?
Let's go!
Wait! Sir!
I'm not the only one who saw him.
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?
Well, he was a key witness, and I...
Two days to find the otter,
or you quit.
That was the deal.
Badge.
- But, sir, we had...
- Badge!
Uh, no.
- What did you say, fox?
- Sorry, what I said was 'no...'.
She will not be giving you that badge.
Look, you gave her a clown vest,
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile,
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?
Yeah, it's no wonder she needed
to get help from a fox.
None of you guys were gonna help her,
were you?
Here's the thing, chief.
You gave her the 48 hours,
so technically we still have...
ten left to find our Mr. Otterton.
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
So if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.
Good day.
Officer Hopps.
Thank you.
Never let them see that they get to you.
So...
Things do get to you?
I mean not, not anymore.
But I was small that's true.
But I was small that's true.
I think I was 8,
maybe 9...
And all I wanted to do was join
the Junior Ranger Scouts.
So my mom scaped together enough money
to buy me a brand new uniform.
Because, by god, I
was gonna fit in.
Even if I was the only predator
in the troop, the only fox.
I was gonna be part of a pack.
- Ready for initiation?
- Yeah. Pretty much born ready.
I was so proud.
Okay. Now raise your right
paw, and deliver the oath.
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave,
loyal, helpful and trustworthy.
Even though you're a fox?
What?
No, no! What did I
do wrong, you guys?
No, please! What did I do wrong?
What did I do?
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle?
You're even dumber than you look.
Is he gonna cry?
I learned two things that day.
One:
I was never gonna let anyone
see that they got to me.
And two?
If the world's only gonna see
a fox as shifty and untrustworthy...
There's no point in trying
to be anything else.
Nick, you are so much more than that.
Boy, look at that
traffic down there.
How about we go up to
Chuck in traffic central?
Chuck, how are things looking
on the jam cams?
Nick, I'm glad you told me.
The jam cams...
- Seriously, it's okay.
- No, no no!
There are traffic cameras everywhere.
All over the canopy!
- Whatever happened to that jaguar...
- The traffic cameras would have caught it!
- Bingo!
- Ho-ho! Pretty sneaky, slick!
However, if you didn't have
access to the system before,
I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is
gonna let you into it now.
No. But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.
Eh. Sir, if we could just review
these very important billings.
Sir! Oh, I'm sorry.
Sir.
Okay! I heard you, Bellwether,
just take care of it!
Please.
And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.
Oh, no, no. But, sir, you do
have a meeting with
Herds and Gradings.
Sir, that's just, oh...
Oh, mutton chops.
Assistant Mayor Bellwether,
we need your help.
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.
- So fluffy!
- Hey!
- Sheep never let me get this close!
- You can't just touch a sheep's wool!
- It's like cotton candy.
- Stop it!
Where to?
Ah... Rainforest Dsitrict.
Vine and Tujunga.
There.
Traffic cams for the whole city.
This is so exiting actually.
I mean, well, you know.
I never get to do
anything this important.
But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia.
Oh.
I'm more of a glorified secretary.
I think Mayor Lionheart just
wanted the sheep vote.
But he did give me that nice mug.
WORLD'S GREATES ASSISTANT MAYOR (Written with marker)
DAD (Crossed out)
Feels good to be appreciated.
Smellwether!
Ah.
That's a fun little name he likes to use.
I called him Lionfart once,
he did not care for that.
Let me tell you, it was
not a good day for me.
- Yes, sir.
- I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon.
Oh, dear. I better go.
Let me know what you find.
It was really nice for me to be...
While we're young, Smellwether.
You think when she goes
to sleep she counts herself?
Shush.
Okay, traffic cams..
Tujunga.... Tujunga....
We're in.
- Who are these guys?
- Eh. Timberwolves.
Look at these dum-dums.
Huh!
Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl.
And there it is.
I mean, what is it with wolves
and the howling, it's...?
Howlings!
Night Howlers!
That's what Manchas was afraid of, wolves!
The wolves are the Night Howlers!
- If they took Manchas..
- I bet they took Otterton too.
All we gotta do is find out
where they went.
Wait, where'd they go?
You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal,
which I never have, I would use the
maintenance tunnel 6B.
Which would put them out...
right there.
Well, look at you, junior detective.
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.
Eh. How dare you.
Ok, Shaly.
Focus on what we got.
South canyon.
Mm-hm.
They're heading out of town.
Where does that road go?
[ CLIFFSIDE ]
Gary, quit it!
You're gonna start a howl!
I didn't start it.
Come on.
You are a clever bunny.
It looks like this was a hospital.
You know, after you,
you're the cop.
Okay, all clear.
Ha.
All this equipment is brand new.
Carrots.
Claw marks.
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks.
What kind of...
Mr. Manchas.
It's him!
We found our otter.
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.
We're gonna get you out of here now.
Or not.
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.
11, 12, 13, 14.
Not including Manchas,
it's... it's fourteen.
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.
They're all here...
All the missing mammals are right here.
Huh!
Enough!
I don't want excuses, doctor,
I want answers.
Mayor Lionheart, please.
We're doing everything we can.
Really?
Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here
who've gone off the rails crazy,
And you can't tell me why.
Now I'd call that awfully far
from doing everything!
Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.
What?
What do you mean 'biology'?
The only animals going savage are predators.
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.
Hm, great idea.
Tell the public.
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor who is a lion?!
- I'll be ruined!
- Well, what does Chief Bogo say?
Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we
are going to keep it that way.
Oh, no!
- Someone's here.
- Sir, you need to go. Now.
Security, sweep the area.
Great, we're dead.
We're dead. That's it. I'm dead.
You're dead. Everybody's dead.
- Can you swim?
- What?
Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?
Aaahhhh!
Carrots!
Hopps! Judy!
We gotta tell Bogo!
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now.
- Wait, is that Gazelle?
- No!
I'm Gazelle, and you
are one hot dancer.
You have the app too?
Ooohhh... Chief!
Clawhauser! Can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?
Oh! Yes, of course.
About that, sir.
Officer Hopps just called,
she found all of them.
Wow, I'm impressed.
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything you...
You don't understand,
I was trying to protect the city!
You were just trying
to protect your job.
No, listen. We still don't
know why this is happening.
It could destroy Zootopia.
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.
Ladies and gentlemammals,
14 mammals went missing and
all 14 have been found...
by our newest recruit,
who will speak to you in a moment.
- I'm so nervous.
- Okay, press conference 101.
You wanna look smart, answer their question
with your own question
and then answer that question.
Like this: 'Excuse me, Officer Hopps.
What can you tell us about the case?'
'Well, was this a tough case?
Yes, yes it was.' You see?
You should be
up there with me.
We did this together.
Well, am I a cop?
No. No, I am not.
Funny you should say that.
Because, well, I've been thinking.
It would be nice to have a partner.
Here. In case you need
something to write with.
Officer Hopps.
It's time.
So now, I'll turn things over to the officer
who cracked the case.
Officer Judy Hopps.
Yes?
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?
Well, the animals in question...
Emm.
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes, they are.
Okay, so what is the connection?
Oh. All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.
So predators are the
only ones going savage?
That is accu..
Yes, that is accurate, yes.
- Why? Why is this happening?
- We still don't know.
But, emm.
It may have something to do with biology.
What do you mean, biology?
A biological component.
You know, something in their DNA.
In their DNA,
can you elaborate on that, please?
Yes. What I mean is
thousands of years ago
Eh, predators survived through their...
agressive hunting instincts.
For whatever reason, they seem to be
reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.
Officer Hopps, could
it happen again?
It is possible.
So, we must be vigilant.
And we at the ZPD are prepered
and are here to protect you.
How would ZPD protect us?
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.
That's all the time that we have.
No more questions.
- Was I okay?
- Oh, you did fine.
That went so fast, I
didn't get a chance to
mention you or say anything
about how we...
Oh, I think you said plenty.
What do you mean?
'Clearly there's a
biological component'?
'These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways'?
Are you serious?
I just stated the
facts of the case.
I mean, it's not like a
bunny could go savage.
Right, but a fox could? Huh?
- Nick, stop it, you're not like them.
- Oh, there's a 'them' now?
You know what I mean,
you're not that kind of predator.
The kind that needs
to be muzzled?
The kind that makes you think you need
to carry around fox repellant?
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that
little item the first time we met.
Look. Let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?
Do you think I might go nuts?
You think I might go savage?
You think I might try to eat you?
Huh!
I knew it, huh.
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me, huh?
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.
No, Nick.
Nick!
Officer Hopps, were you just
threatened by that predator?
No, he's my friend.
We can't even trust our own friends?
That is not what I said.
Please.
- Are we safe?
- Have any other foxes gone savage?
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.
A caribou is in critical condition.
The victim of a mauling by
a savage polar bear.
This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week after ZPD Officer,
Judy Hopps connected the violence
to traditionally predatory animals.
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized by
popstar Gazelle was marred by protest.
- Go back to the forest, predator!
- I am from the savannah.
Zootopia is a unique place.
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city.
Where we celebrate our differences.
This is not the Zootopia I know.
The Zootopia I know
is better than this.
We don't just blindly assign blame.
We don't know why these
attacks keep happening.
But it's irresponsible to label all
predators as savages.
It's not my Emmitt.
We cannot let fear divide us.
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.
Come on, Hopps.
The new mayor wants to see us.
The mayor?
Why?
It would seem you've arrived.
Clawhauser?
What are you doing?
Uh. They thought it would be
better if a predator
such as myself wasn't the first face
that you see
when you walk into the ZPD.
What?
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.
It's by the boiler.
Hopps1
Integrity
Honesty
Valor
Emm.
I don't understand.
Our city is 90% prey, Judy,
and right now
they're just really scared.
You're a hero to them.
They trust you.
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I
want you to be the public face of the ZPD.
I'm... not...
I'm not a hero.
I came here to make the world
a better place. But...
... I think I broke it.
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.
Like you.
With all due respect, sir,
a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.
Help the city.
Not tear it apart.
- I don't deserve this badge.
- Hopps.
Judy, you've worked so hard
to get here.
It's what you've wanted since
you were a kid.
You can't quit.
Thank you for the opportunity.
A dozen carrots.
Have a nice day.
Come on.
Hey there, Jude.
Jude the Dude.
Remember that one?
How we doing?
- I'm fine.
- You are not fine, your ears are droopy.
Why did I think I could
make a difference?
- Because you're a trier, that's why.
- You've always been a trier.
Oh, I tried.
And it made life so much worse
for so many innocent predators.
Oh, not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil. Right on time.
Is that Gideon Grey?
Yeah, it sure is.
We work with him now.
He's our partner. And we never
would have considered it,
- had you not opened our minds.
- That's right.
I mean, kid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.
That's...
That's really cool, you guys.
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.
I had a lot of self-doubt,
and it manifested itself
in the form of unchecked
rage and agression.
I was a major jerk.
Well, I know a thing or two
about being a jerk.
Anyhow, I brought you all these pies.
Hey, kids! Don't you run through that
Midnicampum holicithias.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Well, now. There's a
four-dollar word, Mr. H.
My family always just
call them Night Howlers.
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
Oh.
Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy.
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce,
but I don't like the little ones going near them
on acoount of what happened
to your uncle Terry.
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids
and went completely nuts.
He bit the dickens out of your mother.
A bunny can go savage.
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.
Well, sure it did. There's a sizable
divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers.
The flowers are making the predators go savage.
That's it! That's what
I've been missing!
Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys!
Hurry, come on!
Oh. Thank you!
I love you, bye!
- You catch any of that, Bon?
- Not one bit.
That makes me feel a little bit better,
I thought she was talking in
tongues or something.
Who is it?
I need to find Nick.
Please.
Nick?
Nick?
Oh, Nick.
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're toxic flowers.
I think someone is targetting predators
on purpose and making them go savage.
Wow.
Isn't that interesting?
Wait, please don't..
I know you'll never forgive me.
And I don't blame you.
I wouldn't forgive me either.
It was ignorant, and irresponsible,
and small-minded.
But predators shouldn't suffer
because of my mistakes.
I have to fix this.
But I can't do it without you.
And...
And after we're done...
you can hate me.
And...
And that'll be fine.
Because I was a horrible
friend and I hurt you.
And you can walk away knowing
that you were right. All along.
I really am just a dumb bunny.
'I really am just a dumb bunny.'
'I really am just a dumb bunny.'
Don't worry, Carrots,
I'll let you erase it. In 48 hours.
All right, get in here.
Okay. Oh, you bunnies.
You're so emotional.
There we go, deep breath.
Are you-Are you just
trying to steal the pen?
Is that what this is?
- You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off!
- I'm sorry.
HOPPS
FAMILY FARM
I thought you guys only grew carrots.
Mmph.
- What's your plan?
- We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.
Okay, how?
- Know this guy?
- Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody.
Ha-ha. Well, hello!
Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.
All your favorite movies.
I've got movies that
haven't even been released yet.
Hey, 15% off.
20!
Make me an offer.
Come on!
Well, well, look who it is,
the Duke of Bootleg.
What's it to you, Wilde?
Shouldn't you be melting down
a pawpsicle or something?
Hey, if it isn't
flopsy the copsie.
We both know those weren't only
onions I caught you stealing.
What were you gonna do with
those Night Howlers, Weselton?
It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton.
And I ain't talking, rabbit.
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.
Ice him.
Ahhh!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ah!
You dirty rat, why are you helping her?
She's a cop!
And the godmother to
my future granddaughter.
- I'm gonna name her Judy.
- Ohhhh...
Heh heh heh.
Ice this weasel.
Aww! All right, all right!
Please! I'll talk. I'll talk.
I stole the Night Howlers
so I could sell them.
They offered me what I
couldn't refuse: Money.
And to whom did you sell them?
A ram named Doug. We got
a drop spot underground.
Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.
He's unfriendly.
Come on.
The weasel wasn't lying.
Yeah, it looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.
You got Doug here.
What's the mark?
Cheetah in Sahara Square.
Got it.
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast,
I can hit him.
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter
through the open window of a moving car.
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news.
You know, whichever comes first.
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.
All right, Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now. Out.
Hey. Wait, where you going?
Where are you going? Get back here!
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!
What are you looking at?
Hey!
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it.
Carrots.
Carrots.
You better have the
extra foam this time.
HA!
Hey!
Open up!
What are you doing? You
just trapped us in here!
We need to get this
evidence to the ZPD.
- Okay, great. Here it is. Got it.
- No, all of it.
Wait, what?
Oh, great, you're a
conductor now, huh?
Hey. Listen. It would take a miracle
to get this rustbucket going.
Well.
Hallelujah.
We kinda got a situation at the lab.
It just got worse!
Mission accomplished.
Would it be premature for me to
do a little victory toot-toot?
All right.
One toot-toot.
Well, I can cross that off
the bucket list.
I may have to rescind
that victory toot-toot.
Maybe that's just hail.
Back off!
Incoming!
- Carrots!
- Don't stop! Keep going.
No, stop.
Please stop!
Do not stop this car!
Ahhh!
Owww!
Whoa!
- Speed up, Nick. Speed up!
- There's another train coming!
Trust me, speed up.
Stop the train!
Hey.
Need some help?
Oh, no. Oh, no no no.
Too fast! Too fast! Hold on!
I think this is our stop.
Okay, maybe...
Maybe some of the evidence survived.
Everything is gone.
We've lost it all.
Yeah. All, except for this.
Ah, ha ha ha ha!
- Ooh, Nick! Yes!
- Ow.
Come on!
We gotta get to the ZPD.
Cut through the Natural History Museum.
- There it is.
- Judy. Judy!
Mayor Bellwether.
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a serum.
That's what's making them go savage.
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job.
Thank you, ma'am.
How did you know
where to find us?
I'll go ahead and
I'll take that case now.
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.
- Run.
- Run.
Get them!
Ah....
Carrots!
Aww.
Here, I got you.
Get in here.
Okay.
Now, just relax.
Whoops.
- Blueberry?
- Pass.
Come on out, Judy.
Take the case.
Get it to Bogo.
I'm not gonna leave you behind,
that's not happening.
- I can't walk.
- Just.. We'll think of something.
We're on the same team, Judy.
Underestimated.
Underappreciated.
Aren't you sick of it?
Predators.
They may be strong and loud.
But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.
Think about it. 90% of the population
united against a common enemy.
We'll be unstoppable.
Huh?
Over there!
Oh!
Ah!
Well, you should have just
stayed on the carrot farm, huh?
It really is too bad,
I did like you.
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?
Oohhh.
No, of course not.
He is.
No!
Oh, Nick?
Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the
Natural History Museum!
Officer Hopps is down.
Please hurry!
No, Nick.
Don't do this. Fight it.
Oh, but he can't help it.
Can he?
Since predators are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.
Get back!
Gosh!
Think of the headline!
'Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox.'
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?
Yeah.
Pretty much.
It won't work.
Fear always works.
And I'll dart every predator in
Zootopia to keep it that way.
Ah!
Oh, Nick.
No.
Bye-bye, bunny.
Blahhh...
Blood, blood, blood!
And death.
All right, you know you're milking it.
Besides, I think we got it.
I think we got it.
We got it up there,
thank you, yakety-yak.
You laid it all out beautifully.
What?
Yeah. Oh, are-are you looking for the serum?
Well, it's right here.
What you've got
in the weapon there,
those are blueberries,
from my family's farm.
Mmmuch. They are delicious.
You should try some.
I framed Lionheart,
I can frame you too.
It's my word against yours.
Ooo.
Actually...
'And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.'
- It's your word against yours.
- Huh?
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.
Boom!
Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today,
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks
that have plagued Zootopia of late.
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot,
claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.
Did I falsely imprison those animals?
Well, yes.
Yes, I did.
It was a classic doing the wrong thing
for the right reason kind of a deal.
In related news, doctors say the Night Howlers'
antidote is proving effective
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.
Oh, Emmitt!
Thank you.
When I was a kid,
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.
Where everyone got along,
and anyone could be anything.
Turns out, real life is a little bit more
complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker.
Real life is messy.
We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.
Which means, hey, glass half full,
we all have a lot in common.
And the more we try to
understand one another.
The more exceptional each of us will be.
But we have to try.
So no matter what type
of animal you are.
From the biggest elephant,
to our first fox.
I implore you.
Try.....
Try to make the world a better place.
OFFICER
Nicholas P. Wilde
Look inside yourself and recognize
that change starts with you.
It starts with me.
It starts with all of us.
- Yeh!
- Yeh!
All right, all right, enough.
Shut it!
We have some new recruits
with us this morning.
Including our first fox.
Who cares.
Hah. You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.
Shut your mouth, Wilde.
Assignments.
Officers Grizzoli, Fragmire, Delgato.
Tundratown SWAT.
Snarlof, Higgins, Wolfard.
Undercover.
Hopps, Wilde.
Parking duty.
Dismissed.
Just kidding!
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.
Find him.
Shut him down.
So are all the rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?
Oops.
Sorry.
Heh heh.
Sly bunny.
Dumb fox.
You know you love me.
Do I know that?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour,
I hope you have a good explanation.
Flash, Flash.
Hundred Yard Dash!
Nick...
Good evening, Zootopia!
Come on, everybody.
Put your paws up.
I messed up tonight,
I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again
I keep falling down
I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next
I wont give up,

Till I reach the end
And then Ill start again
Though Im on the lead
I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail

Till I reach the end
And then Ill start again
No I won't leave
I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
Oh oh oh oh

Dougal... you settle down now, please.
It wont be long.
Next.
British, huh? -Yes.
-First trip to New York? -Yes.
Anything edible in there?
-No.
Livestock?
Must get that fixed... ahh, no.
Let me take a look.
Welcome to New York.
-Thank you.
Next!
And it was like a... like a
wind or like a... like a ghost...
but dark... and I saw its eyes.
Shinin white eyes...
A dark wind... with eyes.
-Like a dark mass,
and it dove down there, down underground.
Someone ought do something about it.
It's everywhere this thing.
It's out of control.
Hey, did you get anything?
-Dark wind, blah blah.
Its some atmospheric hooey.
Or electrical.
Hey, you thirsty? -Nah, Im on the
wagon. Promised Martha Id lay off.
It's atmospheric.
This great city sparkles with
the jewels of mans invention!
Movie theaters, automobiles,
the wireless, electric lights.
All dazzle and bewitch us!
-So sorry.
But where there is light
there is shadow, friend.
Something is stalking our city, wreaking
destruction and then disappearing without a trace.
Listen to me.
We have to fight, join us,
the Second Salemers, in our fight!
-Excuse me, doll. -You hear me?
Just trying to get to the bank.
-We have to fight together...
Excuse me, trying... -Watch it!
-So sorry, my case.
No harm done.
Excuse me!
-You, friend!
What drew you to our meeting today?
Oh... I was just passing.
-Are you a seeker?
A seeker after truth?
Im more of a chaser, really.
Hear my words and heed my warning.
And laugh if you dare.
Witches live among us!
We have to fight together for the sake
of our children, for the sake of tomorrow!
What do you say to that, friend?
Excuse me.
Can I help you, sir?
No, I was just... just... waiting.
Hi.
What brings you here?
-Same as you...
Youre here to get a loan
to open up a bakery? -Yes.
What are the odds of that?
Well, may the best man win, I guess.
-Excuse me.
Hey, mister... Hey, mister!
Hey, fella! -Mr. Kowalski,
Mr. Bingley will see you now.
Okay... Okay.
You are currently working
in a canning factory?
Thats the best I can
do... I only got back in 24.
Got back?
-From Europe, sir.
Yeah... I was part of the
Expeditionary Forces there.
All right. -Mr. Kowalski. -You
gotta try the paczki. Okay?
Its my grandmothers
recipe, the orange zest... just...
Mr. Kowalski, what do you propose
to offer the bank as collateral?
Collateral?
-Collateral.
There are machines now that can
produce hundreds of doughnuts an hour...
I know, I know, but theyre
nothing like what I can do.
The bank must be
protected, Mr. Kowalski.
Good day to you.
Hey, Mr. English guy!
I think your egg is hatching.
What? What just happened?
But...
Excuse me...
I was... over there. I was... over there?
In you hop...
-Hello?
No. Everyone settle down. Stay.
Dougal, dont make me come in there.
Dont make me come down there.
Absolutely not!
Alohomora!
Oh, so youre gonna steal the money, huh?
Petrificus Totalus!
Mr. Bingley!
Kowalski!
Really?
No... Look at that.
Look.
Oh no... No, no, no.
Dont shoot. Dont shoot!
What? For the last time, you pilfering
pest... paws off what doesnt belong to you.
Im awfully sorry about all that.
What the hell was that?
-Nothing that need concern you.
Now unfortunately you have seen far
too much, so if you wouldnt mind...
if you just stand there, this
will be over in a jiffy. -Sure, yeah.
Sorry...
Bugger.
Who are you?
-Im sorry?
Who are you? -Newt Scamander. And you
are? -Whats that thing in your case?
Thats my Niffler.
Youve got something on your... -Why in the name
of Deliverance Dane did you let that thing loose?
I didnt mean to, hes incorrigible, you
see, anything shiny, hes all over the place.
You didnt mean to? -No. -You could not have
chosen a worse time to let that creature loose!
Were in the middle of a situation here!
Im taking you in.
-Youre taking me where?
Magical Congress of the
United States of America.
So, you work for MACUSA?
What are you, some kind of investigator?
Can you please tell me you
took care of the No-Maj?
The what? -The No-Maj!
No-magic... the non-wizard!
Oh, sorry, we call them Muggles.
-You wiped his memory, right?
The No-Maj with the case?
Thats a Section 3A, Mr.
Scamander. Im taking you in.
Come on.
Er... sorry, but I do have things to do,
actually. -Well, youll have to rearrange them!
What are you doing in New York anyway?
-I came to buy a birthday present.
Couldnt you have done that in London?
No, theres only one breeder
of Appaloosa Puffskeins
in the world and he lives in New York, so no.
I got a Section 3A.
By the way, we dont allow the breeding
of magical creatures in New York.
We closed that guy down a year ago.
Hey, Goldstein.
-Hey, Red.
Major Investigation Department.
-I thought you was...
Major Investigation Department!
I got a Section 3A!
The International Confederation
is threatening to send a delegation.
They think this is related to
Grindelwalds attacks in Europe.
I was there. This is a beast.
No human could do what this thing
is capable of, Madam President.
Whatever it is, one things
clear, it must be stopped.
Its terrorizing No-Majs and when
No-Majs are afraid, they attack.
This could mean exposure.
It could mean war.
I made your position here
quite clear, Miss Goldstein.
Yes, Madam President, but I...
-You are no longer an Auror.
No, Madam President, but...
-Goldstein.
Theres been a minor incident... -Well, this office
is currently concerned with very major incidents.
Get out.
-Yes, maam.
So, you got your wand permit? All
foreigners have to have them in New York.
I made a postal application weeks ago.
Scamander... And you were
just in Equatorial Guinea?
Ive just completed a year in the field.
Im writing a book about magical creatures.
-Like... an extermination guide?
No. A guide to help people understand why
we should be protecting these creatures
instead of killing them.
-Goldstein! Where is she?
Where is she? Goldstein!
Goldstein!
Did you just butt in on the
Investigative Team again?
Whereve you been?
-What?
Whered she pick you up?
-Me?
Have you been tracking them Second
Salemers again? -Of course not, sir.
Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir!
-Afternoon, Abernathy.
Mr. Graves, sir, this is Mr. Scamander.
He has a crazy creature in that case
and it got out and caused
mayhem in a bank, sir.
Lets see the little guy.
But, sir...
Tina...
Im sorry, Grandma.
My momma, your momma,
gonna catch a witch.
My momma, your momma,
flying on a switch.
My momma, your momma,
witches never cry.
My momma, your momma,
witches gonna die!
Witch number one, drown in
a river!
Witch number two,
gotta noose to give her!
Witch number three,
gonna watch her burn.
Witch number four, flogging
take a turn.
Collect your leaflets before
you get food, children.
Is it a witchs mark, maam?
No. Hes okay.
I cant believe you
didnt obliviate that man!
If theres an inquiry, Im finished! -So why
would you be finished? Im the one thats...
Im not supposed to go
near the Second Salemers!
What was that?
Er... moth, I think. Big moth.
Hey, quiet down. Im trying to get a statement.
-Im telling you its a gas explosion again.
I aint taking the kids back
up there until its safe. -Sorry, maam.
There aint no smell of gas.
-It wasnt gas, Officer, I seen it!
It wuzza... a gigantic...
a huge hippopotto gas. Gas.
I don't know.
Mr. Scamander.
It was open?
Just a smidge... -That crazy
Niffler things on the loose again?
It might be.
-Then look for it! Look!
His necks bleeding, hes hurt!
Wake up, Mr. No-Maj.
Mercy Lewis, what is that?
-Nothing to worry about. That is a Murtlap.
What else have you got in there?
You!
-Hello.
Easy, Mr...
-Kowalski... Jacob.
You cant obliviate him!
We need him as a witness.
Im sorry, youve just yelled at me the length
of New York for not doing it in the first place.
Hes hurt! He looks ill!
-Hell be fine. Murtlap bites arent serious.
I admit that is a slightly more
severe reaction than Ive seen,
but if it was really serious,
hed have...
What?
Well, the first symptom
would be flames out of
his anus...
-This is balled up!
Itll last forty-eight hours at most!
I can keep him if you want me to.
Oh, keep him? We dont
keep them! Mr. Scamander,
do you know anything about the wizarding community
in America? -I do know a few things, actually.
I know you have rather backwards laws
about relations with non-magic people.
That youre not meant to befriend
them, that you cant marry them,
which seems mildly absurd to me.
-Whos going to marry him?
Youre both coming with me.
-I dont see why I need to come with you.
Help me!
-Im dreaming, right?
Please. -Yeah, Im tired,
I never went to the bank.
This is all just some big nightmare, right?
-For the both of us, Mr. Kowalski.
And so this is the newsroom.
Let's go.
Hey, how are you? Make
way for the Barebones!
Now, theyre just putting the
papers to bed, as they say.
Mr. Shaw, sir, hes with the senator.
Never mind that, Barker,
I wanna see my father!
Im so sorry, Mr. Shaw, but your son insisted.
-Father, youre going to want to hear this.
Ive got something huge!
Your brother and I are busy here,
Langdon. Working on his election campaign.
We dont have time for this.
This is Mary Lou Barebone from
the New Salem Preservation Society,
and shes got a big story for you!
-Oh, she has, has she?
Theres strange things
going on all over the city.
The people behind this,
they are not like you and me.
This is witchcraft, dont you see.
-Langdon. -She doesnt want any money.
Then either her story is worthless,
or shes lying about the cost.
Nobody gives away anything valuable
for free, Langdon. -You are right, Mr. Shaw.
What we desire is infinitely more
valuable than money: Its your influence.
Millions of people read your newspapers and
they need to be made aware about this danger.
The crazy disturbances in the
subway, just look at the pictures!
Id like you and your friends to leave.
-No, youre missing a trick here.
Just look at the evidence.
-Really. -Langdon.
Just listen to Father and go. And...
Take the freaks with you.
-This is Fathers office, not yours. -Okay.
And Im sick of this every time I
walk in here... -That's it. Thank you.
We hope youll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.
Were not difficult to find.
Until then, we thank you for your time.
Hey, boy.
You dropped something.
Here you go, freak. Why dont you put
that in the trash where you all belong.
Take a right here.
Okay, before we go in... Im not
supposed to have men on the premises.
In that case, Mr. Kowalski and I can easily
seek other accommodation. -Oh no, you dont!
Watch your step.
That you, Tina?
Yes, Mrs. Esposito!
-Are you alone?
Im always alone, Mrs. Esposito!
Teenie, you brought men home?
Gentlemen, this is my sister.
You want to put something on, Queenie?
-Sure.
So, who are they?
-Thats Mr. Scamander.
Hes committed a serious infraction
of the National Statute of Secrecy.
Hes a criminal?
-Uh-huh.
And this is Mr. Kowalski, hes a No-Maj.
-A No-Maj?
Teen, what are you up to?
-Hes sick, its a long story.
Mr. Scamander has lost something,
Im going to help him find it.
You need to sit down, honey.
Hey, he hasnt eaten all day.
Thats rough, he didnt get
the money he wanted for his bakery.
You bake, honey?
I love to cook.
-Youre a Legilimens?
Uh-huh, yeah. But I always have trouble
with your kind. Brits. Its the accent.
You know how to read minds?
-Dont worry, honey.
Most guys think what you was
thinking, first time they see me.
Now, you need food.
Hot dog... again? -Dont read my
mind! -Not a very wholesome lunch.
Hey, Mr. Scamander,
you prefer pie or strudel?
I really dont have a preference.
You prefer strudel, huh, honey?
Strudel it is.
Well, sit down, Mr. Scamander.
Were not going to poison you.
Youre upset. Its your mother again.
Somebodys said something,
what did they say? Tell me.
Do you think Im a freak? -No, I
think youre a very special young man
or I wouldnt have asked
you to help me, now would I?
Have you any news?
-Im still looking.
Mr. Graves, if I knew
whether it was a girl or boy...
My vision showed only
the childs immense power.
He or she is no older than ten,
and I saw this child in close
proximity to your mother.
She I saw so plainly.
That could be any one of hundreds.
-There is something else.
Something I havent told you.
I saw you beside me in New York.
Youre the one that gains this childs trust.
You are the key, I saw this.
You want to join the wizarding world.
I want those things too,
Credence. I want them for you.
So find the child. Find the
child and well all be free.
The job aint that glamorous. I
mean, I spend most days making coffee,
unjinxing the john.
Tinas the career girl.
Nah. Were orphans. Ma and Pa died
of dragon pox when we were kids.
Youre sweet. But we got each other!
Could you stop reading
my mind for a second?
Dont get me wrong,
I love it.
This meal, its insanely good!
This is what I do, Im a cook.
And this is, like, the greatest
meal I have ever had in my life.
Oh, you slay me! I aint never really
talked to a No-Maj before.
Really?
I am not flirting!
Im just saying, dont go getting attached,
hes going to have to be obliviated!
Its nothing personal.
Hey, you okay, honey? -Miss Goldstein, I think
Mr. Kowalski could do with an early night.
And besides, you and I will need to be up
early tomorrow morning to find my Niffler, so...
Whats a Niffler?
-Dont ask.
Okay, you guys can bunk in here.
I thought you might like a hot drink?
Hey, Mr. Scamander...
Look, cocoa!
The toilets down the hall to the right.
-Thanks...
Very much.
Come on.
For the love of...
Will you sit down?
-Good idea.
Thats definitely the Murtlap. You
must be particularly susceptible.
See, youre a Muggle. So our
physiologies are subtly different.
Stay still. Now that
should stop the sweating.
And one of those should sort the twitch.
Take that.
Come on...
What you got there? -This
the locals call Swooping Evil,
not the friendliest of names.
Its quite an agile fellow.
Ive been studying him. And
I am pretty sure his venom
could be quite useful if properly diluted.
Just to remove bad memories, you know.
Probably shouldnt let
him loose in here, though.
Come on.
Come on. Down you come.
Come on.
Oh, thank Paracelsus.
If youd have got out that could
have been quite catastrophic.
You see, hes the real
reason I came to America.
To bring Frank home.
No, sorry, stay there, hes a
wee bit sensitive to strangers.
Here you are, here you are.
He was trafficked, you see.
I found him in Egypt, he was all chained up.
Couldnt leave him there,
had to bring him back.
Im going to put you back where
you belong, arent I, Frank?
To the wilds of Arizona.
Here they come. -Here
who comes? -The Graphorns.
Youre all right. Youre all right.
Hello, hello!
So theyre the last
breeding pair in existence.
If I hadnt managed to rescue them, that
could have been the end of Graphorns, forever.
All right.
What, you rescue these creatures?
-Yes, thats right.
Rescue, nurture, and protect them,
and Im gently trying to educate
my fellow wizards about them.
Come on.
Titus? Finn? Poppy, Marlow, Tom?
He had a cold. He needed some body warmth.
Right, on you hop.
See, he has some attachment issues.
-Now, come on, Pickett.
Pickett. No, theyre not going
to bully you. Now, come on.
Pickett!
All right. But that is exactly
why they accuse me of favoritism.
I wonder where Dougals gone.
All right, Im coming, Im
coming, Mums here. Mums here.
Hello, you, let me take a look at you.
-I know these guys.
Your Occamy.
-What do you mean? My Occamy?
Yes, do you want to...
Yeah, sure. Okay.
Hey.
-No, sorry, dont pet them.
They learn to defend themselves early. See, their
shells are made of silver so theyre incredibly valuable.
Okay. -Their nests tend to
get ransacked by hunters.
Thank you.
Mr. Scamander?
-Call me Newt.
Newt, I dont think Im dreaming.
What gave it away?
-I aint got the brains to make this up.
Actually, would you mind throwing some of
those pellets in with the Mooncalves over there?
Yeah, sure.
-Just over there...
Bugger, Nifflers gone. Of
course he has, little bugger.
Any chance to get his
hands on something shiny.
What did you do today, Jacob?
I was inside a suitcase.
Hey. Hello, fellas. All right, all right.
Take it easy, take it easy.
Cutie. There it is.
Step back.
-Jeez...
Step back. -Whats the matter
with this? -I said step away. -Yeah.
What the hell is this thing?
-Its an Obscurus.
I need to get going, find everyone
whos escaped before they get hurt.
Before they could get hurt? -Yes, Mr. Kowalski.
Theyre currently in alien terrain,
surrounded by millions of the most
vicious creatures on the planet.
Humans.
So where would you say that a medium-sized
creature that likes broad, open plains,
trees, water holes, that kind
of thing, where might she go?
In New York City?
-Yes. -Plains?
Central Park? -And where is that
exactly? -Where is Central Park?
Well, look, I would come and show you,
but dont you think its
kind of a double cross?
The girls take us in,
they make us hot cocoa.
You do realize that when they see youve stopped
sweating, theyll obliviate you in a heartbeat.
What does Bliviate mean? -Itll be like
you wake up and all memory of magic is gone.
I wont remember any of this?
-No.
All right, yeah, okay, Ill help you.
Come on, then.
Credence, where have you been?
I was looking for a place
for tomorrows meeting.
Theres a corner on
Thirty-Second Street that could...
Im sorry, Ma. I didnt realize it was so late.
I was watching you at dinner. -Yeah.
-People like you, dont they, Mr. Kowalski?
Well, Im sure people like you too, huh?
-No, not really. I annoy people.
Why did you decide to be a baker?
Well, because Im dying
in that canning factory.
Everyone theres dying. It just crushes the
life outta you. You like canned food? -No.
Yeah. Me neither. Thats why I want to make pastries, you
know. It makes people happy. Were going this way.
So did you get your loan?
No, I aint got no collateral. Stayed in
the army too long, apparently, I dont know.
You fought in the war? -Of course I fought in the war,
everyone fought in the war. You didnt fight in the war?
I worked mostly with dragons,
Ukrainian Ironbellies,
Eastern Front.
Finestra.
Accio!
All right? Happy?
One down, two to go.
They went that way, Officer.
-Hands up!
What the hell is that?
Lion...
You know, New York is considerably
more interesting than Id expected.
Put this on. -Why would I have
to wear something like this?
Because your skull is susceptible
to breakage under immense force.
But we made em cocoa.
Right.
Okay, if you just, pop this on.
-Okay.
Now, theres absolutely
nothing for you to worry about.
Tell me, has anyone ever believed
you when you told them not to worry?
My philosophy is that worrying
means you suffer twice.
Shes in season. She needs to mate.
Erumpent musk,
she is mad for it.
Good girl...
Come on, into the case.
Oh, no.
Repar...
Merlins beard!
Theyre exactly the same.
Same thing.
-Newt!
No, no, no, dont!
Im so sorry.
Good show, Mr. Kowalski!
Call me Jacob.
Two down, one to go.
In you hop.
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonights keynote speaker
needs no introduction from me.
Hes been mentioned
as a future president.
And if you dont believe me,
just read his daddys newspapers.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the senator for New York, Henry Shaw!
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you.
And its true we have made some progress,
but there is no reward for idleness.
So just as the odious
saloons have been banished...
What's going on?
So now the pool halls, and
these private parlors...
What is that?
Witches!
Our American friends have permitted
a breach of the Statute of Secrecy,
that threatens to expose us all.
I will not be lectured by the man who let
Gellert Grindelwald slip through his fingers.
Madam President, Im so sorry to
interrupt, but this is critical.
Youd better have an excellent excuse
for this intrusion, Miss Goldstein.
Yes, I do.
Maam. Yesterday a wizard
entered New York with a case.
This case full of magical creatures,
and unfortunately, some have escaped.
He arrived yesterday?
You have known for twenty-four
hours that an unregistered wizard
set magical beasts loose in New York
and you see fit to tell us
only when a man has been killed?
Who has been killed?
-Where is this man?
Scamander?
Hello, Minister.
-Theseus Scamander? The war hero?
No, this is his little brother.
And what are you doing in New York?
I came to buy an Appaloosa
Puffskein, sir. -Right.
What are you really doing here?
Goldstein, and who is this?
This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President,
hes a No-Maj who got bitten by
one of Mr. Scamanders creatures.
No-Maj?
-Obliviated?
Merlins beard.
You know which of your creatures
was responsible, Mr. Scamander?
No creature did this. Dont pretend!
You must know what that
was, look at the marks...
That was an Obscurus.
You go too far, Mr. Scamander.
There is no Obscurial in America.
Impound that case, Graves!
-Wait. No. Give that back. -Arrest them!
Dont hurt those creatures.
Please, you dont understand, nothing
in there is dangerous, nothing!
Well be the judges of that!
Take them to the cells!
Dont hurt those creatures, nothing
in there is dangerous!
Please, dont hurt my creatures! They aren't
dangerous! Please, they are not dangerous!
They are not dangerous!
I am so sorry about your
creatures, Mr. Scamander.
I truly am.
Can someone please tell me what this
ObscurialObscurius thing is? Please?
There hasnt been one for centuries.
I met one in Sudan three months ago.
There used to be more of
them but they still exist.
Before wizards went underground,
when we were still
being hunted by Muggles,
young wizards and witches sometimes
tried to suppress their magic
to avoid persecution.
Instead of learning to harness
or to control their powers,
they developed what
was called an Obscurus.
Its an unstable, uncontrollable Dark
force that busts out and attacks...
And then vanishes.
Obscurials cant
survive long, can they?
Theres no documented case of any
Obscurial surviving past the age of ten.
The one I met in Africa
was eight when she...
She was eight when she died.
What are you telling me here, that
Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?
My momma, your momma,
flying on a switch.
My momma, your momma,
witches never cry.
My momma, your momma,
witches gonna die!
Witch number one, drown in
a river!
Witch number two,
gotta noose to give her!
Hand out your leaflets!
-Witch number three...
Ill know if you dump em. Tell
me if you see anything suspicious.
It was good to make your acquaintance,
Jacob, and I hope you get your bakery.
Youre an interesting man, Mr. Scamander.
-Mr. Graves...
You were thrown out of Hogwarts
for endangering human life...
That was an accident!
-With a beast.
Yet one of your teachers argued
strongly against your expulsion.
What makes Albus
Dumbledore so fond of you?
I really couldnt say.
So setting a pack of dangerous
creatures loose here was...
Was just another accident, is that right?
-Why would I do it deliberately?
To expose wizardkind.
To provoke war between the
magical and non-magical worlds.
Mass slaughter for the
greater good, you mean?
Yes. Quite.
Im not one of Grindelwalds
fanatics, Mr. Graves.
I wonder what you can tell
me about this, Mr. Scamander?
Its an Obscurus.
But its not what you think.
I managed to separate it from the
Sudanese girl as I tried to save her.
Wanted to take it home, to study it.
But it cannot survive outside that
box, it could not hurt anyone, Tina!
So its useless without the host?
"Useless?" "Useless?"
That is a parasitical magical force that killed
a child. What on earth would you use it for?
You fool nobody, Mr. Scamander.
You brought this Obscurus into the city of New
York in the hope of causing mass disruption,
breaking the Statute of Secrecy
and revealing the magical world.
You know that cant hurt anyone, you know that!
-You are therefore guilty of a treasonous betrayal
of your fellow wizards
and are sentenced to death.
Miss Goldstein, who has
aided and abetted you...
No, shes done nothing of the kind.
-She receives the same sentence.
Just do it immediately. I will inform
President Picquery myself. -Tina.
Please.
Dont do this, Bernadette, please...
It don't hurt.
Tina...
-Momma... -Tina...
Come on, pumpkin, time
for bed. Are you ready?
Dont that look good?
You wanna get in? Huh?
Hey, Sam! -Hey, Queenie.
-They need you downstairs.
Ill obliviate this guy.
-You aint qualified.
Hey, Sam, does Cecily
know you been seeing Ruby?
Howd you... -Let me obliviate this guy
and shell never hear about it from me.
What are you doin? -Shh! Teens
in trouble, Im trying to listen...
Jacob, wheres Newts case?
-I think that guy Graves took it.
Okay, come on. -What? Youre
not gonna obliviate me?
Of course not, youre one of us now!
Its okay.
Alohomora.
Aberto...
He would know a fancy
spell to lock his office.
Okay, lets get the good stuff out of you.
Witch!
It's just gonna eat me! -Don't panic!
-What do you suggest I do instead?
Jump.
Are you crazy?
-Jump on him.
Tina, listen to me. Ill catch you.
Tina!
Ill catch you.
Ive got you, Tina. Go!
Come on!
Coming through!
-Move!
Leave his brains, come on!
Come on!
What is that thing? -Swooping
Evil. -Well, I love it!
Get in.
Queenie!
Where you going?
Im sick, Mr. Abernathy.
Again?
Well, whatve you got there?
-Ladies things.
You wanna take a look? I dont mind.
Good gravy, no! I...
You get well now!
-Thanks.
Credence. Have you found the child?
I cant.
-Show me.
Shh. My boy, the sooner we find this child, the sooner
you can put that pain in the past where it belongs.
I want you to have this, Credence.
I would trust very few with it.
Very few.
But you...
Youre different.
When you find the child, touch this symbol
and I will know, and I will come to you.
Do this and you will be
honored among wizards. Forever.
The child is dying,
Credence.
Time is running out.
Your grandfather kept
pigeons? Mine bred owls.
I used to love feeding em.
-Graves always insisted
the disturbances were caused by a beast.
We need to catch all your creatures
so he cant keep using
them as a scapegoat.
Theres only one still
missing. Dougal, my Demiguise.
Dougal?
-Slight problem is that...
Hes invisible.
Invisible?
-Yes, most of the time... He does...
How do you catch something that?
-With immense difficulty.
Gnarlak!
-Excuse me?
Gnarlak, he was an informant
of mine when I was an Auror!
He used to trade in magical
creatures on the side.
He wouldnt happen to have an
interest in paw prints, would he?
Hes interested in anything he can sell.
How do I get a drink in this joint?
What? Aint you ever
seen a house-elf before?
No, no, of course I have.
I love house-elves.
My uncles a house-elf.
Yeah...
Six shots of gigglewater
and a lobe blaster, please.
Are all No-Majs like you?
No, Im the only one like me.
Ive arrested half of the people in here.
You can tell me to mind my own
business, but I saw something
in that death potion back there.
I saw you hugging
that Second Salem boy.
His names Credence.
His mother beats him.
She beats all those kids she adopted,
but she seems to hate him the most.
And she was the No-Maj you attacked?
Thats how I lost my job.
I went for her in front of a
meeting of her crazy followers.
They all had to be obliviated.
It was a big scandal.
Its him.
So...
Youre the guy with the
case full of monsters, huh?
News travels fast.
I was hoping youd be able to tell
me if there have been any sightings.
Tracks. That sort of thing.
Youve got a big price on
your head, Mr. Scamander.
Why should I help you
instead of turnin you in?
I take it Ill have to
make it worth your while?
Lets consider it a cover charge.
MACUSAs offerin moren that.
Lunascope?
I got five.
Frozen Ashwinder egg!
-You see, now were...
Wait a minute.
That's Bow...
Thats a Bowtruckle, right?
No. -Come on.
They pick locks, am I right?
Youre not having him.
-Well,
good luck gettin back alive,
Mr. Scamander, what with the
whole of MACUSA on your back.
All right.
Pickett...
Somethin invisibles been
wreakin havoc around Fifth Avenue.
You may wanna check out
Macys department store.
Might help with what youre looking
for. -Dougal... One last thing.
Theres a Mr. Graves
who works at MACUSA.
I was wondering what you
knew of his background.
You ask a lot of
questions, Mr. Scamander.
That can get you killed.
MACUSA are coming!
-You tipped them off!
Sorry, Mr. Gnarlak...
Reminds me of my foreman!
What are you doin, Credence?
Whered you get this?
-Give it back, Credence. Its just a toy!
What is this?
Take it off!
Ma...
-I am not your Ma!
Your mother was a
wicked, unnatural woman!
It was mine.
-Modesty...
What is this?
So Demiguises are
fundamentally peaceful,
but they can give a
nasty nip if provoked.
You two, head that way.
And try very hard not to be predictable.
Was that the Demiguise?
No, I think it might be the
reason that the Demiguise is here.
Its sight operates on probability,
so it can foresee the most
likely immediate future.
So whats it doing?
-Its babysitting.
What did you just say?
-This is my fault.
I thought I had them all,
but I must have miscounted.
It was babysitting that?
Occamies are choranaptyxic.
So they grow to fill available space.
Mummys here.
We need an insect, any
kind of insect and a teapot!
Find a teapot!
I got it. I got it!
Teapot!
Roach in teapot...
Choranaptyxic.
They also shrink to
fit the available space.
Tell me the truth.
Was that everything that came out
of the case? -Thats everything.
And thats the truth.
Here she comes.
-Happy to be home?
Bet youre exhausted, buddy. Come
on. There you go, thats right.
Right. I think we need to talk.
I wouldnt have let
him keep you, Pickett.
Pick, I would rather chop off
my hand than get rid of you.
After everything you have
done for me, now come on.
Pick, weve talked about
sulking before, havent we?
Pickett...
Come on, give me a smile.
Pickett, give me a...
All right. Now, that is beneath you.
Newt.
Who is she?
-Thats no one.
Leta Lestrange? Ive heard of that family.
Arent they kinda, you know?
-Please dont read my mind.
Sorry, I asked you not to.
-I know, Im sorry.
I cant help it.
People are easiest to read when
theyre hurting. -Im not hurting.
Anyway, it was a long time ago.
That was a real close
friendship you had at school.
Neither of us really fitted in at school.
So we became quite...
-You became real close.
For years.
She was a taker. You need a giver.
What are you two talking about?
-Nothing.
School.
-School.
Did you say school? Is there a school?
A wizardry school here? In America?
Of course, Ilvermorny! Its only the
best wizard school in the whole world!
I think youll find the best wizarding
school in the world is Hogwarts!
Hogwash!
Danger.
He senses danger.
The Obscurial was here?
Where did she go?
Help me. Help me.
Didnt you tell me
you had another sister?
Please help me.
Wheres your other sister, Credence?
-Please, help me. -The little one?
Where did she go?
-Please...
Your sisters in grave danger.
We need to find her.
What is this place?
-Ma adopted Modesty out of here.
From a family of twelve.
She misses her brothers and
sisters. She still talks about them.
Where is she?
I don't know.
-Youre a Squib, Credence.
I could smell it off
you the minute I met you.
What?
-You have magical ancestry, but no power.
But you said you could teach me.
-Youre unteachable.
Your mothers dead. Thats your reward.
Im done with you.
Modesty?
Modesty.
Theres no need to be afraid.
Im here with your brother, Credence.
Out you come, now.
Credence, I owe you an apology.
I trusted you.
I thought you were my friend.
That you were different.
You can control it, Credence.
But I dont think I want to, Mr. Graves.
Jeez. Is that the Obscuriathing?
Thats more powerful than any
Obscurial I have ever heard of.
If I dont come back,
look after my creatures.
Everything that you
need to know is in there. -What?
Theyre not killing it.
Newt! You heard him, look after them!
Keep holda that, honey.
-No, no, no!
I cant take you. Please let go of me, Jacob!
Youre the one that said I was one
of youse, right? -Its too dangerous.
To survive so long, with
this inside you, Credence,
is a miracle. You are a miracle.
Come with me, think of what
we could achieve together.
Newt! -Its the Second Salem
boy. Hes the Obscurial.
Hes not a child.
His power must be so strong,
hes somehow managed to survive.
Newt! Save him.
Mr. Graves.
Tina. Youre always turning
up where you are least wanted.
Contain this, or we are
exposed and it will mean war.
Credence! Credence, I can help you.
Bar the area. -Yes, sir.
-I dont want anyone else down there!
Credence...
Its Credence, isnt it?
Im here to help you, Credence.
Im not here to hurt you.
Ive met someone just like you, Credence.
A girl.
A young girl whod been imprisoned,
she had been locked away and
shed been punished for her magic.
Credence...
Can I come over to you?
Can I come over?
That thing killed my son.
I want justice!
Ill expose you for who you
are and what youve done.
Look! Take... Take photos.
Credence.
Credence, no!
Dont do this.
Please.
Keep talking, Tina.
Keep talking to him, hell
listen to you. Hes listening.
I know what that woman did to you.
I know that youve suffered.
You need to stop this now.
Newt and I will protect you.
This man... He is using you.
-Dont listen to her, Credence.
I want you to be free.
Its all right.
-Thats it.
Dont, youll frighten him.
-Wands down!
Anyone harms him, theyll
answer to me. Credence! -Credence...
No. No!
Credence...
You fools.
Do you realize what youve done?
The Obscurial was killed on
my orders, Mr. Graves. -Yes.
And history will surely
note that, Madam President.
What was done here tonight was not right!
He was responsible for
the death of a No-Maj.
He risked the exposure
of our community.
He has broken one of
our most sacred laws.
A law that has us scuttling
like rats in the gutter!
A law that demands that
we conceal our true nature!
A law that directs those under
its dominion to cower in fear
lest we risk discovery!
I ask you, Madam President.
I ask all of you...
Who does this law protect?
Us?
Or them?
I refuse to bow down any longer.
Aurors, Id like you to
relieve Mr. Graves of his wand
and escort him back to...
Accio.
Revelio.
Do you think you can hold me?
Well do our best, Mr. Grindelwald.
Will we die, just a little?
I figured somebody oughta
keep an eye on this thing.
Thank you. -We owe you
an apology, Mr. Scamander.
But the magical community is exposed!
We cannot obliviate an entire city.
Actually, I think we can.
I was intending to wait
until we got to Arizona,
but it seems like now you
are our only hope, Frank.
Ill miss you too.
You know what youve got to do.
They wont remember anything.
That venom has incredibly
powerful obliviative properties.
We owe you a great
debt, Mr. Scamander.
Now, get that case out of New York.
Yes, Madam President.
Is that No-Maj still here?
Obliviate him. There can be no exceptions.
Im sorry, but even one witness.
You know the law.
Ill let you say good-bye.
This is for the best.
Yeah, I was, I was never
even supposed to be here.
I was never supposed to know any of this.
Everybody knows Newt only
kept me around because...
Newt, why did you keep me around?
Because I like you.
Because youre my friend
and Ill never forget
how you helped me, Jacob.
Ill come with you.
Well go somewhere, well go anywhere.
See, I aint never gonna find anyone like.
Theres loads like me.
-No. No.
Theres only one like you.
I gotta go.
Jacob!
-Its okay. Its okay.
Its okay.
Its just like waking up, right?
So sorry, sorry!
Dear Mr. Kowalski, You are
wasted in a canning factory.
Please take these Occamy eggshells
as collateral for your bakery.
A well-wisher.
Its been...
-Hasnt it?
Listen, Newt, I wanted to thank you.
What on earth for?
Well, you know, if you hadnt said all
those nice things to Madam Picquery about me,
I wouldnt be back on the
investigative team now.
Well, I cant think of anyone that
Id rather have investigating me.
Try not to need
investigating for a bit. -I will.
Quiet life for me from now on.
Back to the Ministry. Deliver my
manuscript. -Ill look out for it.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
Does Leta Lestrange like to read?
Who?
-The girl whose picture you carry.
I dont really know what Leta likes
these days because people change.
Yes.
-Ive changed.
I think. Maybe a little.
Ill send you a copy of my book, if I may.
-Id like that.
Im so sorry. How would you feel
if I gave you your copy in person?
Id like that.
Very much.
Where do you get your ideas from, Mr. Kowalski?
-I dont know.
I don't know.
They just come.
Here you go. Dont forget this. Enjoy.
Hey, Henry, storage, all right?
Thanks, pal.

Chow time!
It's time!
Floyd, step up to the door.
Dinner time.
Only my friends call me Floyd.
You ain't got no friends, Floyd.
What's that?
That is called loaf.
A loaf.
It's got a little bit
of pasghetti in there.
Toenails.
Rat shit.
Everything a growing fella needs,
like you.
Come here. Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a secret?
Yeah.
One day...
Somehow, some way,
I'm gonna get outta here.
And I'm gonna rain down on you
like the holy ghost.
Man, you just threatened
a staff member.
Yeah?
Yeah, you have.
Do something.
Let's have some fun.
Whoop his ass!
Open the goddamn gate!
Come on, guys.
Don't waste my time.
Sector C! Pull your heads out of your ass!
The boss is on deck!
Open it!
Bravo 14 open perimeter fence.
Stay back.
If she moves,
fire her up, all right?
You gonna come down
from there or what?
Yeah.
Look at you.
You know the rules, hotness.
You gotta keep off these bars.
- What, these bars?
- Yeah. Those bars.
Oh, my god.
You are really in bad shape upstairs, lady!
Gonna come in here
and tell me that?
Or are you too scared?
Come on, I'm bored.
I'm bored.
Play with me.
You put five of my guards
in the hospital, honey.
No one's gonna play with you.
You sleep on the ground.
I sleep where I want,
when I want, with who I want.
Oh, man.
I love you.
Alpha one.
Hit her.
Come on, man. You're six foot four.
She's a tiny little girl.
You got a choice tonight.
What we got here?
We got chocolates,
strawberry or vanilla.
My job is to keep you alive until you die.
Do you understand that?
Spring break!
That is just a whole lot of pretty
in a whole lot of crazy.
The world changed
when Superman flew across the sky.
And then it changed again
when he didn't.
Remember.
And that is why I'm here.
Suicide squad
Hello, Amanda.
We lose a national hero...
But you sit there looking like
the cat that ate the canary.
I've eaten a lot of canaries.
It's taken some work.
But I finally have them.
The worst of the worst.
There's rumors, Amanda that...
Some of them have abilities.
The rumors are right.
You know what the problem
with a metahuman is?
The human part.
We got lucky with Superman.
He shared our values.
The next Superman might not.
You're playing with fire, Amanda.
I'm fighting fire with fire.
You are not going to pitch us that task
force x project of yours again, are you?
Yes
but this time, you're gonna listen.
Floyd lawton, aka Deadshot.
Deadshot
family: Daughter, ex-wife
he's the most wanted hitman
in the world.
Let's say he has an elite clientele.
What?
Hey, Angelo.
This is the exterminator you called
for your rat problem.
My account's looking a little thin.
No one gets paid until
what needs to get done gets done.
Nope. That's not the rules.
No money, no honey.
Whoa, here is your boy right now.
With about 20 of his
new best friends.
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie.
Listen.
Stop being cute and do your job!
Oh.
They're taking him outta the car now.
In about 30 seconds,
your window is gonna close forever.
Okayay, okay, okay.
Relax.
There was an accounting error.
We sent it.
Now double it for being a dickhead.
You got 10 seconds.
We're not the kind of people
you play with.
Did you just...
Did you threaten me?
This dude's gonna get a sore throat
from all the singing he's about to do.
You son of a bitch.
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie.
But everyone has a weakness.
And a weakness can be leveraged.
His is an 11-year-old
honor student in Gotham city.
His daughter.
So we watched her and waited.
You should talk to mama more.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Mama stays in bed a lot.
Yeah.
She's still going out at night?
Dad, it's okay.
I can take care of her.
I know how to make pancakes now.
Hey babe, that's beautiful.
She's supposed to be taking
care of you, you know.
That's how that's
supposed to work.
I want you to come live with me.
All right? I came into some resources.
I'm gonna get us spot.
It's gonna be nice, all right?
Mama says I can't live with you
because you kill people.
That's not true. That's a lie.
She's lying to you.
Daddy...
I know you do bad things.
Don't worry.
I still love you.
Come on.
And you caught him?
Not me.
I just gave an anonymous tip
to the right guy in Gotham city.
I'mma figure this out.
All right?
It's over, Deadshot.
I don't want to do this
in front of your daughter.
Daddy, please.
Zoe, move!
Please Daddy.
Don't do it.
Please.
Don't do it.
All right.
I love you, Daddy.
So now we have the man
who never misses.
Where'd you put him?
Let's just say. I put him in a hole
and threw away the hole.
Harley Quinn.
Accomplice to the murder of Robin
ARKHAM
Before she ran off
and joined the circus...
She was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel.
A psychiatrist at Arkham asylum.
She was assigned to the clown himself.
Dr. Quinzel.
You know,
I live for these moments with you.
What do you got?
I got you a kitty.
So thoughtful.
She thought she was curing him...
But she was falling in love.
There is something you
could do for me, doctor
Anything.
I mean, yeah.
I need a machine gun.
A machine gun?
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong.
Get off me!
Get...!
What do we have here?
I did everything you said.
I helped you.
You helped me by erasing my mind
what in memories I had!
Now,
you left me in a black hole
of rage and confusion.
Am I not the medicine you practice,
Dr. Quinzel?
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me, Mr. J?
What?
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm just gonna hurt ya...
really, really bad.
You think so?
Well, I can take it.
I wouldn't want you to break those
perfect porcelain cap teeth
when the juice hits your brain.
La la.
La la la.
They became the king and
queen of Gotham city.
And god help anyone
who disrespected the queen.
We finally meet.
He don't shake hands.
But sit down and have a drink.
Hey, J.
On behalf of everybody,
welcome back.
I wanted to come by and
personally say thank you.
You making me good money.
I'm making you good money.
Are you sweet talking me?
Ha. Ha. Ha.
I love this guy.
He's so intense!
You're lucky man.
You got a bad bitch.
Oh, that she is.
The fire in my loins.
The itch in my crotch.
The one, the only,
the infamous Harley Quinn!
Oh, come to Daddy.
- Puddin'!
- Oh yeah.
Listen..
You are my gift to this
handsome hunka hunka!
You belong to him now.
Well.
You're cute!
You want me?
I'm all yours.
I don't want no beef.
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?
- Why, what's wrong? You don't like me?
- You don't want no beef?
Fine.
Don't waste my time then.
This is your lady.
Look...
Are you enjoying yourself?
No.
That's your lady, joker.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
Yo, J.
And that was just the beginning.
Come on, puddin'.
Do it!
Oh...
We have got company.
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy.
She's crazier than him.
And more fearless.
Stupid bat, you're ruining date night!
Puddin'.
Puddin', I can't swim!
But the bat got her, too.
She's in the same hole as Deadshot.
And then there's the aussie.
Digger Harkness.
Or as the tabloids call him.
Capitan Boomerang.
Captain boomerang
fetishes:Font color="#ff80c0" pink unicorns
We're gonna be rich.
Yeah, you and me, mate.
Go and get the car.
He robbed every bank in Australia
at least once.
Then he came to America
for a fresh target set.
Doesn't work well with others.
No honor among thieves, eh?
But he tangled with a metahuman
and lived to tell about it.
And have you heard of
the pyro kinetic homeboy?
How'd you catch him?
We didn't.
He surrendered.
Chato Santana.
On the streets they call him El diablo.
This LA gangbanger thought
he was the king of the world...
Until he lost his queen.
Gets jumped in a prison riot
and incinerates half the yard.
The security video is incredible.
Oh, Jesus.
- What the hell is that?
- His name is Waylon Jones.
Evolution took a step backwards
with this one.
Yo, K.C!
It's supper.
Go ahead,
open that up, B.
Got something real nice
for you today, boy.
Hey boss, is it true he chewed
the dude's hand off?
Look at that, right there,
vulcanized rubber
Give me that, Smitty.
Where you at?
Don't make me get you.
They call him Killer Croc.
There you are, are you hungry?
You want some food?
Go ahead, feed the man.
What are you
in the mood for tonight?
I got a double cheese burger,
onion rings, a little coleslaw.
Or a giant skinless goat?
He looked like a monster.
So they treated him
like a monster.
Then he became a monster.
He was chased out
of Gotham by the Bat.
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere.
He never found it.
I saved the best for last.
The Witch.
A witch?
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting,
making-shit-disappear witch.
A sorceress from another dimension.
Another world.
Archaeologist Dr. June Moone...
Wondered into the wrong cave.
June...
She opened something she shouldn't have...
releasing a metahuman more powerful
than any we've encountered.
The enchantress.
Enchantress aka dr June Moone
she inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.
Where is this witch?
In my pocket.
Now tell him why she won't
turn you into a frog.
Some say the witch has
a secret buried heart...
And whoever finds it
can control the witch.
So we searched the cave
where she turned up...
And we found her heart.
- That thing's her heart?
- Mmm.
She's vulnerable without it.
You want to put our
national security in the hands of...
Witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?
Don't forget about
the joker's girlfriend.
These are villains, Amanda.
What makes you think
you can control them?
Because getting people to act
against their own self-interests...
For the national security of the United
States is what I do for a living.
You take the finest special forces officer
this nation has ever produced...
Colonel Rick Flag.
Colonel Rick Flag.
Help me.
I assigned him to watch Dr. Moone,
and just as I hoped...
It got personal.
Are you gonna
kiss me or not?
I have the witch's heart.
And Dr. Moone has his.
Now he'll follow my orders
as holy writ.
In a world of flying men and monsters...
This is the only way
to protect our country.
The Pentagon Washington DC
what if Superman had decided to fly down,
rip off the roof of the white house...
And grab the President of the United States
right out of the overall office?
Who would've stopped him?
We got contingency plans
for nukes in north Korea...
Anthrax in our mail.
We got fluoride in our water.
But what happens
if the next Superman...
Becomes a terrorist?
Amanda Waller has a plan.
Amanda.
I wanna build a team of some very bad
people who I think can do some good.
Like fight the next war,
defeat the next Superman.
Not on my watch.
You're not putting those monsters
back out on the street in our name.
General, we run them covertly
non-attributed. Strictly need to know.
And if they get caught,
we throw them under the bus.
The next war will be fought
with these metahumans.
Ours, or theirs.
We're not the only ones
kicking up rocks looking for them.
You know we can't
control these people.
June, be strong.
Dr. Moone.
Enchantress.
Meet the enchantress.
Everything we know about her,
is in your briefing packs.
She's walked this earth
for a very long time
and will likely be here
when we're long gone.
This meeting is-
is now a magic show?
Magic or not, this girl can do
some pretty incredible things.
Go get it, girl.
How about a little something from
the Weapons ministry vault in Tehran?
We've been chasing
these plans for years.
Please don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.
Thank you.
We'd like Dr. Moone back.
Enchantress.
Please.
Please.
I'm sorry.
I can't-I can't do that again.
Flag, get her out of here.
I move to...
Authorize Amanda Waller to establish
Task force X under the Argus program.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. chairman.
I know you do bad things.
Don't worry.
I still love you.
Welcome to Belle Reve,
special security barracks.
How you doing, man?
Why don't you kiss her ass?
She's in charge.
Welcome, ma'am.
How are you?
I'm here to assist you in anyway.
Where are they?
Are you the devil?
Maybe.
Ain't you scared?
Why'd they put you down here?
I asked.
Open that gate.
Yo, ese
Hola, amigo.
Put that burrito down.
You got visitors, man.
What's up?
Hey, you want some of this?
Come down here.
That ain't me.
That wasn't you?
Nah, they say it's me,
but that ain't me.
That guy's gone.
He's dead.
And yet, here you are.
Ma'am.
Let me try to talk to him.
You wanna die in here, buddy?
You got a real shot at
walking at the block again.
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal.
A women.
Look, man...
You ain't the first to ask,
and you ain't gonna be the last.
Ask what?
I'm a man, okay?
I ain't no weapon.
I'mmna die in peace before
I raise my fists again.
I've caused enough harm.
Bye
All right, unlock him.
What?
You heard me.
You know what this man can do?
I'm here to find out.
Lose the restraints.
Thank you.
What?
This uh...
Cheerleading tryouts?
Let's go.
Let's see what you can do.
They say you never missed a shot.
Prove it.
Now you got one in the chamber.
What cha' gonna do with it?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey!
- Shit!
- Drop it.
Give me the word, boss.
I'll drop him.
Everybody calm down.
Griggs, tell your men to stand down.
Tell them to put it down.
Stand down!
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly
what I was concerned about!
What's for dinner?
Ames, if this man shoots me...
I want you to kill him...
And I want you to go
clear my browser history.
See...
The firing pin is filed down, right?
Mag full of dummy rounds.
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.
You're absolutely right.
Why would we give a loaded weapon
to an infamous hitman?
Go ahead, pull the trigger.
Empty it.
Don't empty nothing.
You don't even know this lady.
I've known you,
like, nine months.
Remember when I brought you that cookie?
That was a real cookie.
Aw, shit.
What?
Shit.
Oops
Oh...
Y'all jokers must be crazy.
All right.
Now you know what you're buying.
Let me tell you the price.
First...
I want outta here.
Second, I want full custody
of my daughter.
All right?
And her mom can have like...
Supervised visits.
But her stank ass boyfriend can't come.
Darnell can't come.
- Darnell's out.
- He's out.
Third, y'all gonna pay for
my daughter's whole education.
Best schools.
And then I want her
to go to college
like Harvard or Yale.
- Ivy league.
- Ivy league, yeah.
- One of them big joints, you know?
- Mm-hm.
And if she can't cut it,
and her grades start slipping,
- I need you to white-people that thing.
- Mm-hm.
- You know how y'all do.
- Oh yeah.
You know, right?
Okay.
Now that's my price.
But I'm concerned, 'cause I don't
see nobody writing shit down.
You're in no position
to make any demands.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
You thought I was talking to you.
No, errand boy.
I'm talking to your boss.
That's my price, sweetie.
You know what it is.
You notice these are criminals?
Mm.
They're psychotic antisocial freaks.
It makes no sense.
Let me hit the tier one units
and I'll build you
a team of pipe hitters who'll do
anything you can dream up.
I mean, you need real soldiers.
Not these scumbags.
In World War 2, the US Navy
made a deal with the mafia
to protect it's ships
on the waterfront.
This ain't World War 2.
It's World War 3.
What are you really up to?
It's a "need to know", and, all you
need to know is you work for me.
That can change with a phone call.
I have friends too, you know.
There you go.
Call'em.
But without you minding her,
your lady friend stays here
strapped to a board
in a drug-induced coma.
They warned me about you.
My dumbass didn't believe the stories.
Nobody does.
Where is she?
It's complex.
This is not just her.
Everybody's disappeared.
There's this new law,
where if you're a bad enough bad guy,
they stamp "terrorist" on your jacket.
They send you to
this swamp in Louisiana.
A black site.
That's where she is.
So what do we do?
Bring the car around.
We're going for a drive.
Lester. Lester.
Hit me one more time!
And...
Come on, man!
You gotta call upstairs and tell them
to float me another 10k.
- You got it?
- Hey.
- Boss wants to see you.
- You know who I am?
Good job, man.
He's killing it.
Come on, man.
Why am I here?
All right! Yeah! I'm down.
I get it, all right?
I've had a run of bad decks.
Not my fault.
All right?
Dude, this is real.
I had to stop these guys
from burning down your house
with your kids in it.
But, you're lucky.
Yeah, maybe.
Why-why do you think so?
Yo, slick.
What's up?
Griggs.
You are?
You might wanna keep your mouth shut.
Can I go, man?
What the hell's going on, man?
This is crazy.
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah,
blah-blah, blah-blah.
All of that chitchat
is gonna get you hurt.
Oh!
My god.
I could tell you meant that.
Yeah.
You're gonna be my friend.
Enchantress.
Log time of death, 16:20
June?
- Let's get her down to the morgue.
- June?
June?
June.
June.
What did you do?
Shhh.
Okay.
Sister.
Brother.
Plus, it could be the routing number.
Wanna go for drinks?
I got this.
Enchantress.
God damn it!
June... June!
June, I'm sorry.
June.
She...
She went somewhere.
If you have to choose
between her or me...
Stop her.
Promise me you'll stop her.
Even if it kills me.
Sir?
Sir, you okay?
Can you breathe?
Did you take anything?
This is 21.
Send medical to my location.
I'm a physician.
Roger.
Bringing medical to your location.
No pulse.
Starting compressions.
Sir.
Midway city is under attack.
It's a non-human entity.
I think you know what to do, sir.
Activate Task force X
and get Amanda Waller
and her whole circus
on scene asap.
Yes, sir.
We're gonna live with Task force X.
Pull 'em.
Prisoners, get down on your knees.
Now!
Down on your knees! Hands in the air!
Turn around.
Hands up high!
Hey, I'm cooperating.
All right?
- This is me being cool.
- Take her.
Do not fire that goddamn weapon!
Damn it!
Open the gate!
Everybody, line up for extraction.
Let's go!
Let's move, move!
Yeah!
Open the door! Let's go!
- Alright. Go! Go!
- Move it! Move it!
Hit him!
Hurry up, before he smokes us!
Where you at?
Whoa!
Is that the new guy?
What is that?
What is that?
- Who are you?
- Standby, arming device.
Who are you?
I don't know who you are.
- Device armed.
- Hey.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Injection successful.
Location verified.
Anybody who touches me is dead.
Anybody who tou...
Ahh!
Lady.
- Injection successful.
- Hey.
- Hey! Miss? What was that?
- Location verified.
- Oh.
- Next!
Oh, you deaf.
You one of them deaf hoes.
- Oh.
- All right, all right. Come on.
Shut up, and get it done.
Weeee.
Listen, you're being transferred.
I don't know where you're going.
It's from Mr. J.
You gonna tell him
I took care of you?
You're so screwed.
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
Get off me!
Get off me!
Harley, what do you mean by that?
Harley!
Hey, I got a delivery.
I have a gift basket for Dr. Van Criss.
You're not on the access list.
I can't let you in. Sorry.
Hey, cool.
Can I leave it with you?
I'm way behind today.
Thank you.
You're a good man.
Open up.
Just please, do whatever they say.
Do whatever they say.
Just do it.
This look neat.
Light it up! Light it up!
Light it up!
He's right above us.
This is a mistake.
Rick, I can't do this.
- I can't...
- Listen. Listen.
There's no other way.
Just get it done.
Just get it done.
Enchantress.
Flag, talk to me.
What' going on down there?
Amanda, she bolted.
Say it again?
She bolted!
Shit!
Go!
Worldwide military is on alert.
Our weapons are ineffective.
- I thought this was contained!
- Pull everyone back to the evacuation zone.
Guys, I need all three of you,
follow me please.
Anybody a universal donor?
Anybody with blood.
Bring those two over here.
Blunt trauma, right forehead!
This is the worst day of my life.
All evacuees must report
to a fema representative.
What's going on in that city?
Those assholes here yet?
Yeah, they're here.
Alpha, bravo team, on me.
What the hell, Flag?
Unlock 'em.
Hi, boys!
Harley Quinn.
How do you do?
Huh?
What was that?
I should kill everyone and escape?
Sorry.
The voices.
I'm kidding.
Jeez.
That's not what they really said.
What do we got here?
12 pounds of shit
in a 10-pound sack.
Welcome to the party, capitan boomerang.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey...
What's going on, man?
Calm down.
Hey, one minute I'm playing mahjong
with me Nanna...
Then this red streak
hits me outta nowhere.
Shut up!
You were caught robbing a diamond exchange.
I was not.
Here comes slipknot...
The man who coould climb anything.
Wonderful.
Have a good time, scumbag.
Straighten up.
She had a mouth.
Listen up!
In your necks...
Injection you got,
it's a nanite explosive.
It's the size of a rice grain
but it's powerful as a hand grenade.
You disobey me, you die.
You try to escape, you die.
You otherwise irritate or vex me,
and guess what?
You die.
I'm known to be quite vexing.
I'm just forewarning you.
Lady, shut up!
This is the deal.
You're going somewhere very bad...
To do something that'll get you killed.
But until that happens...
You're my problem.
So was that like a pep talk?
Yeah.
That was a pep talk.
There's your shit.
Grab what you need for a fight.
We're wheels up in 10.
You might wanna work on
your team motivation thing.
- You heard of Phil Jackson?
- Yeah.
He's like the gold standard, okay?
Triangle, bitch.
Study
what?
Yo, get out of here.
Won't fit anymore?
Too much junk in the trunk?
Nah.
Every time I put this on,
somebody dies.
And?
I like putting it on.
Goody.
Something tells me a whole lotta
people are about to die.
Yeah, it's us.
We're being led to our deaths.
Speak for yourself, mate.
Hey, what's that crop on your face?
Does it wash off?
Hey, if you like a girl, can you
light her cigarette with your pinkie?
Because that would be real classy.
Hey, y'all might wanna
leave old boy alone.
He could torch this whole joint.
Ain't that right, ese?
Ain't got nothing to worry
about from me.
I'm cool, homie.
Behold the voice of god.
For those of you who
don't know me officially...
My name is Amanda Waller.
There's an active terrorist event
in midway city.
I want you to enter the city,
rescue hvt-1 and get them to safety.
I'm sorry.
For those of us who don't speak good guy,
what is HVT-1?
The only person that
matters in the city,
the one person you can't kill.
Complete the mission, you get
time off your prison sentence.
Fail the mission, you die.
Anything happens to colonel Flag,
I'll kill every single one of you.
Remember, I'm watching.
I see everything.
There's your pep talk.
Compared to your shit, she killed it.
So that's it?
What, we some kind of suicide squad?
I'll notify your next of kin.
Alpha, bravo team.
Mount up!
Your' late.
I was busy.
I beg you.
Please have mercy.
This is katana.
She's got my back.
She can cut all of you in half
with one sword stroke...
Just like mowing the lawn.
I would advise
not getting killed by her.
Her sword traps
the souls of its victims.
Harley Quinn.
Nice to meet you.
Love your perfume.
What is that?
The stench of death?
Whoa.
Easy, cowgirl.
Ain't that kind of mission.
Have a seat.
She seems nice.
I'm coming for you
Shhh...
Hey.
Is he suppose
to be green like that?
Oh.
Party foul.
Not cool.
Ooo.
Look at that pretty lights!
Are you guys seeing this?
What happened?
Terror attack.
Dirty bombs, bad guys
shooting up the place with AKs.
You know, usual shit.
Right.
Yeah, you're a bad liar.
I don't know if they told you...
But I'm a hitman.
I'm not a fireman.
I don't save people.
Anything for a dollar, right?
You know the dark places, too.
Don't act like you don't.
I'm a soldier.
And you're a serial killer
who takes credit cards.
When the shooting starts,
and it will,
you'll cut and run.
6-1 is going down.
6-1 is going down hard.
Stand by. Drop the ramp.
Drop the ramp.
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
Go, go!
Come on!
All right. All right. All right.
Relax.
What a ride!
We're okay. We're okay.
Assets are undamaged.
Mind games.
- What's that?
- All this bomb in the neck crap.
That ain't real, mate
see, they're trying to trap us
with our own minds, right?
But you look around,
we're free, brah.
How do you know this?
Just trust me.
I know, all right? It's a con.
Now I'm going,
because I got a life to live.
Question is, are you coming?
- Yeah.
- Smart.
Where're you going?
Hold your fire.
Sorry.
It's what I do.
Nanite detonation control armed
damn it.
Now that's killer app.
Okay.
You wanna keep playing
the Hollywood squares version of
"I'll blow your freaking head off?"
Are you next?
You tripping, homie.
You next, Deadshot?
Did you just threatened me?
Oh, yeah.
He just threatened me.
Move.
You have a boyfriend?
All right, I'm gonna kill him.
Well, you better make it quick 'cause
he's gonna kill all of us one by one.
I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady.
5 or 7 of these seals.
After that, I'm gonna need some help,
you down?
Always.
What about the shit in our necks?
Your friend's gonna
help us out with that, right?
You're my friend, too.
Stay evil, doll face.
Spread the word.
So, I'm thinking if we move together
we can kill all of these guys
and go our separate ways, yeah?
Sounds good.
Spread the word.
Psst, hoy.
Hoy.
We need your help, man.
When the time is right,
you hit Flag with a fireball,
he'll be too busy burning to death
to have a go at us with his final doom.
Then what?
Then we get out of here.
And do what?
What are you, a bloody socker?
Ease with all the questions.
Freedom, man.
Freedom, you remember that, don't you?
We're criminals, you know that, right?
Yeah, it's great.
Come on, do the bastard.
Hey, becareful.
- He eats people.
- Solemn mother superia, what?
He eats people for reals, homie.
He's a cannibal.
Ah.
No.
What did you say to him?
Nothing.
Just having a laugh.
No worries.
I'm standing by
for follow on tasking.
C2, what is the
operational load of the PLS?
Boss, we got people up here.
I'm on my way.
Shit!
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead.
Flag, get out of there.
We're not here to fight them.
We know that doesn't work.
Copy that.
We're diverting.
Bump out second squad
two blocks east.
We'll pass through you,
continue north.
Take bravo two blocks east.
We'll leapfrog through you
once you're in position.
Copy that.
Hey.
I like these odds, mate.
You just say the word.
Yeah.
Come on.
Yeah.
Uh.
Hold that thought.
Rick, why do they look like that?
Stay cool.
What the hell are they?
You cut and run.
I'll blow your head off.
Damn it.
Hit 'em!
Huh.
Hey.
Get off me!
Get off me, you son of a...
Flag!
- Good riddance.
- Harley!
He dies, we die.
- Thanks.
- Shut up.
Backblast, clear!
Pinky.
That's how I cut and run.
Hey.
Hey, come on.
What?
I saw it move.
See? It flinched.
I think.
Hey.
You were some help, Princess.
It's better this way.
Trust me.
Oh, yeah.
You're the fire bloke. Eh?
- Yeah, I was. Yeah.
- Right, yeah. Hey.
Well, look at here.
It's fire!
The brief said terrorist.
- You want to start explaining this?
- If I told you, would you believe me?
- What are they?
- I don't know.
That's bullshit.
Thing is, he owned a $3000 watch.
Is that a person?
It was.
Now it's not.
Hey, don't!
What?
We got a job to do.
We're moving.
Get your boys moving.
Let's go.
Waller, we are moving on the objective.
We lost contact with bravo,
you got a visual?
Stand by.
Anything on the other squad?
No, ma'am.
Go-7, I need your sensors
in those coordinates.
Flag, it's a negative.
They were engaged when you were,
but we lost them.
Seriously?
What the hell is wrong
with you people?
We're bad guys.
It's what we do.
Hey, Deadshot,
I've been thinking.
We don't come together,
no one walking out of here alive.
Mm.
And?
These people respect you,
you got influence.
- What's your threat right now?
- You're a man of your word, right?
I want my mission.
And you want your life
and your kid back.
You help me keep this
motley corporate in line,
I'll hook you up.
While there is the puppet master,
- you ain't got shit to hook me up with.
- I got plenty of my own strings to pull.
You just get me to the top
of that target building
and get my rescuee
on that extraction helo...
- And you're going to make sure I get paid?
- Yeah, you get paid.
You get paid and
you get your fresh start.
Take a knee.
Our body's at the top of that building.
We get up there...
Pull them out of the vault
they're hiding in.
Helos extract us off the roof.
- It's Miller time.
- Check
Flag, who's up there?
I'ts none of your concern.
- Do you know who's up there?
- Nope.
You...
You're not leaving me.
You're not leaving me!
You, you, you
are a pain in the ass.
I have done everything your said,
every test, every trial, every initiation.
I have proved I love you,
just accept it.
Gada gada gada ga...
I am not someone who is...
loved.
I'm an idea,
state of mind.
I excute my will
according to my plan and you...
Doctor, are not part of my plans.
Please let me in.
I promise...
Let me in.
I promise I won't hurt you.
Promise?
Promise?
Hey, dickface!
Mind screaming at your bitch
somewhere else.
I was going to say,
"I wouldn't do that if I were you."
Don't hurt me.
I'll be your friend.
Do it.
Do, do, do, do, do it.
My heart scares you
and a gun doesn't?
DO IT!
If you weren't so crazy,
I'd think you're insane.
Go... away.
Harlet, you coming?
Why do you eat people?
Give me power.
Would you like to eat me?
- Hell, no.
- Aw, why not?
I don't want your crazy.
Says the guys
who lives in a sewer.
At least I know it's a sewer.
Oh, I get it
Because it's like,
this is a sewer too.
Only with nice shops and restaurants, right?
You hate mankind much?
Let me guess.
Mommy didn't take you to
Chuck E. Cheese on your 6th birthday.
I can recommend a good therapist.
Why?
Because I'm bored.
I need a victim, a mind to
pry apart and spit in.
You just leave it, mate.
She's a rabbit hole, don't fall in.
And here's one now.
Japanese, female, mid-twenties,
5 foot 5, good health,
athletic and...
an only child,
with deep seeded father issues.
Daddy wanted a son,
so she has to hide behind a mask.
I am not... hiding.
Yeah, that was gangster.
Harley, why don't you stop
acting like a drunken stripper.
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on then?
Because...
I smell a rat.
If they don't blow our heads off,
we'll have to fight our way
out of this city.
I need you to play nice
with the other children.
And quietly return to my cage.
Sure.
Okay.
Hey, that's okay.
Sellout, I get it.
Like you.
I know how the world works, okay?
And when it comes to the heart,
everyone for themselves, right?
Waller?
We're about to enter the building.
Get that chopper ready.
What you say
we get this over with?
What the hell?
Deadshot.
Fall back.
You mind if we tag along?
Looks like we have
a spot of luck, eh?
Be a walk in the park.
Easy peasy.
Don't make me shoot you.
God damn it.
Harley!
Go. Go. Go.
Go. Go.
I am close be ready...
Hey, guys!
Come on.
Let's go.
Ma'am.
I got motion detectors going off
on the secure floors.
Flag.
- They're all around you.
- Hold.
Use extreme caution.
I don't like this, Flag.
I don't like it either.
Pussy.
I will knock your ass out.
I do not care
that you're a girl.
They're after Flag again!
Son of a bitch!
Get off me!
Circle up!
Circle around him!
Let me fight!
You die, we die.
Clear!
Everyone move out.
- Where've you been, homie?
- This ain't my fight!
You know what?
You don't stand for shit.
You ain't about shit!
Don't touch me, man!
- Don't touch you?
- Don't touch me!
What you gonna do?
I'm touching you! I'm touching you!
- Do something.
- Don't touch me!
Do something!
- You wanna see something?
- Yeah, I wanna see...
- You wanna see something?
- Yes, I wanna see something!
I was just trying
to get you there.
Phil Jackson, we good, right?
I knew you'd come through.
That's shit crazy.
Clear.
I gotta work on my cardio.
Question.
Would you die for me?
Yes.
That's too easy.
Would you...
Would you live for me?
Hm?
Yes
Careful.
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly.
Desire becomes surrender.
Surrender becomes power.
You want this?
I do.
Say it.
Say it.
Say it.
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty...
Please.
God, you're so...
Good.
Oh, relax.
It's just me.
You ever been in love?
Nah, never.
Bullshit.
You don't kill as many people as
I've killed and still sleep like a kitten
if you feel shit like love.
Another textbook sociopath.
Clear.
Clear.
- Nice.
- Clear the roof.
Sweep for shooters so we can
bring in our aviation assets.
Go to the roof.
Just oh...
Wait here.
Please.
I don't wanna gave this dude
a heart attack, okay?
Aww.
He's embarrassed of us.
Hey, Flag.
This dude better cure cancer
after all of this shit.
You ready?
Let's go.
You wouldn't have made it
without them.
We got lucky. I don't do luck.
I do planning and precision.
Admit it, Rick.
I was right.
Yeah, I told you to get on
the damn truck.
Why did you stay?
I was studying your girlfriend.
She takes an average person...
A yoga mom, an elderly retiree
and she turns them into a soldier
who can take a headshot
and still fight.
It's an instant army.
How'd she do it, Flag?
How'd she game the system
with you watching her every move?
I'll accept the consequences
I am your consequence.
You might need to be careful.
They think we're rescuing Nelson mandela.
I can take care of myself.
- Shut it down, wipe the drivers.
- Yes, ma'am.
Copy that.
Hey man,
I know you can't hear me
'cause you're trapped in your
temple of soldierly self-righteousness.
But a two-faced dude like you
wouldn't survive a second on the street.
Oh, says the guy
who shoots people for money.
My cards is on the table, man.
It got done, didn't it?
Damn.
That is just...
A mean lady.
Yeah, you'll get used to it.
And I'm the bad guy?
That's gangsta.
What?
They weren't cleared
for any of this, any of it.
I'm not judging.
I've buried a lot of mistakes too.
No way.
Let's go home.
Yeah, let's go home.
That sounds good.
You guys wanna go home?
Or you wanna go back to prison?
I'm not going back to prison.
What I'm saying is...
We kill the pair of 'em now
before they kill us.
I got this.
You all made it this far.
Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing.
I like her.
Savior 1-0, this is ground element.
Savior 1-0,
how copy?
Savior 1-0, the LZ's clear.
Boss, they're not talking to me.
Our bird's been jacked.
Light it up!
What?
I got a hickey or something?
Professor, could you pick up the pace?
Disarmed
Now!
Harley!
Hello, baby.
Kill her!
Fail - safe mode
Her nanite's disarmed!
Come on, baby.
Deadshot...
Shoot that woman, right now!
She ain't do shit to me.
You're a hitman, right?
I got a contract.
Kill Harley Quinn.
Do it your freedom and your kid.
Now she dead.
I missed.
Good one, mate.
It's Waller.
Savior 1-0's been hijaked.
Shoot it down.
Rager that, ma'am.
Going hot.
Puddin'!
You got all dressed up for me?
Oh, you know I'd do
anything for you.
By the way...
I've got some grape soda on ice,
and a bear skin rug waiting.
Yeah?
Boss, we got a problem!
- This bird is baked.
- No.
Okay, honey.
It's me and you.
Let's do it.
Target destroyed, ma'am
thank you.
Now get me off this roof.
Yes, ma'am.
We're inbound.
The joker and Harley Quinn are no more.
You couldn't save her.
Roger, I see you.
Watch your step, ma'am.
Standby, I'll send another helo!
Waller's down.
It's over.
Ops just confirmed.
She's down, 1k west.
Let's go get her.
The mission's not over.
Nah, it is for me.
We had a deal.
Without Waller, you got nothing.
Hey, guys.
I'm back!
I missed you all so much.
We're glad you could make it.
Hey, craziness.
With my heart returned,
I can finish my weapon.
Now tell me how to
destroy your armies.
Do your worst, bitch!
So, let me guess.
We're going to the swirling
ring of trash in the sky.
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we?
When does this end, Flag?
Load up.
We're in for a fight.
Top secret
You tell everybody, everything.
Or me and you are
gonna go right now.
3 days ago,
a non-human entity
appeared in the subway station.
Waller, we're almost there.
So Waller sent me and
a woman with incredibles abilities.
Enchantress
a witch.
See, nobody could get near this thing,
but...
The witch could.
Bomb's ready.
Set for two seconds.
You just press the
button and drop it.
Needless to say
the whole thing was a bad idea.
She bolted!
Shit!
And that's how
she escaped from Waller.
So now you know.
You can just kill me right now
but...
I'm going to have a drink.
Hey, Deadshot,
I need your help.
No, sir.
You need a miracle.
What's you having, KC?
Bloody mary, right?
Rick goes to mind.
KC, it's the end of the world.
Have a drink with us.
Beer.
There he is.
Give the man a "B".
How about you, hot stuff?
Water.
That's a good idea, honey.
Ninja, you want some sake?
Whisky.
What am I, twelve?
Here's to honor among thieves
I'm not a thief.
Oh.
She's not a thief.
I actually prefer to think of myself
as an asset relocation specialist.
Well, we almost pulled it off.
Despite what everybody thought.
We weren't picked to succeed,
you know that, right?
We were all chosen to fail.
Yeah, I know that.
Worst part of it is, they're gonna
blame us for the whole thing.
And they can't have people
knowing the truth.
We're the patsies.
The cover-up.
Don't forget, we're the bad guys.
So, you're going to tell us now
what your big deal with Flag was.
Same thing Waller offered me,
to kill you.
Chance to be a father.
Chance to have a life
outside the shadows.
I trusted Flag.
Flag had you chasing
a carrot on a stick, homie,
you don't know that?
I love this guy.
You played yourself, dog.
Bitch, I'm having a drink.
I'm... breathing fresh air.
For 2 sweet seconds...
I had hope.
You had hope, huh?
Hope don't stop the wheel
from turning, my brother.
You preaching?
It's coming back around for you.
How many people you killed, man?
You don't ask nobody
no question like that, ese.
You ain't ever
whacked down no women.
No kids.
I don't kill women or children.
I do.
See, I was born with the devil's gift.
I kept it hidden most of my life, but...
The older I got,
the stronger I got.
So I started using it.
For business, you know,
the more power
on the street I got,
the more firepower I got.
Like that shit
went hand in hand.
You know, one was feeding the other.
Ain't nobody tell me no.
Except my old lady.
You know, she used to pray for me.
You're welcome.
Even when I didn't want it.
Six die in arson fire.
God didn't give me this.
Why should he take it away?
Hey.
This is our home.
You put that back
where you found it.
I'm taking my kids to mom's.
You ain't taking my kids nowhere!
See, when I get mad,
I lose control.
You know, I just...
I don't know what I do...
Till it's done.
And the kids?
He killed them.
Didn't you?
Own that shit.
Own it!
What'd you think was
gonna happen, huh?
Hey, Harley.
Come on.
What you were just...
Thinking you can have a happy family...
And coach little leagues
and make car payments?
Normal is a setting on the dryer.
People like us, we don't get normal!
Why is it always a knife fight
every single time
you open your mouth?
You know, outside you're amazing.
But inside, you're ugly.
We all are.
We all are!
Except for him.
He's ugly on the outside, too.
Not me, shorty.
I'm beautiful.
Yeah, you are.
We don't want you here.
You get to the part in that binder
saying I was sleeping with her?
Yeah.
I never been with a witch before.
What's that like?
Apparently that's why the creatures
chase him all the time.
'Cause the witch is scared of him.
The only woman I ever cared about...
Is trapped inside that monster.
If I don't stop the witch, it's over.
Everything is over.
Everything.
You're free to go.
Your daughter writes you everyday.
Every single day.
You had these the whole time?
You had letters from my daughter
the whole time?
I'm gonna get you there.
And you're gonna end this.
I'm gonna carry your ass
if I have to.
'Cause this shit is gonna be
like a chapter in the Bible.
Everybody's gonna know what we did.
And my daughter is gonna know
that her Daddy
is not a piece of shit.
I'll come.
What?
You got something better to do?
Come on!
Pussies.
We think that thing's a weapon.
Here, lower.
We gotta take out the big one.
I left a big ass demo charge
down there in that subway.
There's a flooded tunnel...
Leads right underneath that building.
Seals, they can recover the charge,
swim underneath that thing's feet.
We get in it's face and distract
the hell out of that son of a bitch
so the swimmers can blow the bomb.
That's how we take it out.
I'm going with you.
We got this.
I'm not asking, bro.
I live underground.
Y'all are just tourists.
The man who killed her husband
used that sword.
His soul's trapped inside of it.
She talks to him.
Hey.
Well...
You know what they say
about the crazy ones.
Huh?
Let's do this.
You must really love this girl.
And I thought love was bullshit,
getting serious.
Desire, mutual benefit whatever.
I mean, I get that,
but... actual love?
I mean, I rated that with UFOs.
A lot of believers, no proof.
And then I met June.
Do what you got to do.
I got your back.
You gonna fight with us?
What if I lose control?
Then maybe we'll have a chance.
Duck in.
Hey, everyone can see
all this trippy magic stuff right?
Yeah, why?
I'm off my meds.
That's your old lady, huh?
Yeah.
Well, you need to handle
this shit, alll right?
Get up there, smack on her ass,
tell her knock this shit off.
I do not think that'd be wise.
I'm gonna draw out the big one.
My boys will detonate
the bomb underneath him.
You know, we should
get a drink sometime.
I've been waiting for you all night.
Step out of the shadows.
I won't bite.
What the hell?
Grab her.
Why are you here?
Because the soldier led you?
And all for Waller?
Why do you serve those who cage you?
I am your ally.
And I know what you want.
Exactly what you want.
Normal
normal
Baby.
Baby.
It's just a nightmare.
It's just a bad dream.
I'm here.
Miss me?
I'll put the kids to sleep and then...
Maybe we can kick it?
Yeah?
I can't change what I did.
And neither can you!
He married me.
It's not real.
I killed the bat.
No, homie, you don't want that.
What?
I want that.
She's trying to play games with you, man.
It's not real!
He's right.
It's not real.
How long have you been
able to see?
My whole life.
You can't have them.
These are my people right here.
But it is our time.
The sun is setting
and the magic rises.
The metahumans are a sign of change.
Lady...
You are evil!
Oh, wow!
Uh-oh.
Who is this?
It's gonna be bad!
We should run.
Gq, come in.
We're in position.
We gotta get him in that corner.
That's where the bomb will be.
I'll do it!
I'll get him there!
I lost one family.
I ain't gonaa lose one another.
Look, think it through.
I got this.
Let me show you
what I really am.
Over here!
Go!
Rick, in position.
Standing by.
Diablo, drive him into the corner!
- Get him mate.
- Come on.
Yeah, do it!
Diablo, get clear!
Get out of there!
Blow it!
Blow it.
Now GQ, now.
No!
Everybody down!
You next.
My spell is complete.
Once you and armies are gone,
my darkness will spread across this world.
And it would be mine to rule.
That was our main satellite uplink.
How did this witch even know
how to target this thing?
It's a secret facility.
You got a move here, Flag?
We gotta cut her heart out!
Where is she?
I can't see her!
While we're fighting,
that thing is laying waste
to the whole damn world.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Hey.
Oh shit.
Look out, look out!
Uh-oh.
Sorry.
Flag!
Enough!
Of all who have faced me...
You have earned mercy.
For the last time...
Join me...
Or die.
I'm not much of a joiner but...
Maybe we should.
Hey.
She's trying to take over the world.
So?
What's the world ever
done for us anyway?
It hates us.
Hey.
Harley.
Hey, lady?
I lost my puddin'.
But you can get him back, right?
I can, my dear.
Anything you want.
You promise?
Yes, child.
You need only bow...
And serve beneath my feet.
I like what you're selling, lady.
There's only one teeny problem.
You messed with my friends.
Her heart's out!
We can ends this.
Hey, Croc!
Harley!
Please, Daddy.
Don't do it.
The only way for us to be together
is if you don't pull the trigger.
Daddy, I love you.
Please, don't do this.
That was a great shot, man.
Hey, I don't do hugs.
I'm not a hugger.
I'm not a hugger.
All right?
Let me join my brother.
Katana, no!
Give me that.
You bring June back.
You bring her back.
She's not coming back.
I'll crush this.
Do you hear me?
You bring June back
or I'll crush this!
Go ahead.
You don't have the balls.
Hey, Flag.
June.
She's gone.
I thought I killed you.
I thought I killed you.
Y'all don't mind.
I got me a sewer to crawl back into.
Yeah, and I got some business
to handle back in Gotham.
I'm going to hotwire a car,
need a ride?
Your ass is not driving.
Why not?
How are you not dead?
We-we just saved the world.
A "thank you" would be nice.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, we did all of this
and we don't get shit?
10 years off you prison sentences.
Nah, that's not enough.
I'm seeing my daughter.
That can be arranged.
An other requests?
An Espresso machine.
BET.
10 years off a triple life sentence?
Darling, I'm walking out of here
a free man.
Or we're to start having
some real fun.
Why don't have some fun?
You're trying to figure out this length.
That's the hypotenuse.
So you have to know this angle.
Okay.
So, if you're up here...
- Like an a building.
- Mm.
And you shoot a man down here
on the street...
That's how far
the bullet actually goes?
Yeah.
That's-that's right!
You are so smart.
Right.
The hypotenuse, good one.
So that would make you
have to know the angle
between the building
and the sidewalk.
You got to know that angle.
You know, I mean, in real life
you got-you got variables.
You know, you got rifling twist.
You got chamber pressure.
You got bullet weight.
Some shots you'll even have to take
the curvature of the earth in with the...
It's time.
Wind effect.
You know,
there's a lot-a lot variables...
In the street.
I gotta go.
Are you coming back?
Yeah.
I'm working it out.
All right?
You know, I promised my friends
that I would just, you know, go without...
Without killing them all.
Bring in it.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you.
Hey!
Let me out!
Let me out of here right now!
Hey!
You feel that? Yeah.
Let me out of here, darling, please.
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.
Come on!
Joker
Puddin'!
Let's go home.

This is crown jewels here, Mr. Wayne.
And you do understand
my legal exposure.
If anyone knew what
I've procured for you...
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?
What do you want?
People are asking questions
about Midway city.
The kind of people
who can get the answers.
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.
Consider yourself under my protection,
if you deliver.
Moone, June
Allen, Barry
Curry, Arthur
Why, Mr. Wayne?
I just like to make friends.
That's the difference between us.
You believe in friendship.
I believe in leverage.
Goodnight.
You look tired.
You should stop working nights.
You should shut it down,
or my friends and I
will do it for you.
