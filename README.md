# TheBechdelTest
(In Progress)
Hello and welcome to our Github Repository.

Our goal for this project was to create a interactive story describing the state of female representation (or lackthereof)
in cinema. Using the Bechdel Test as a metric, we detailed the history of successes and failures in the film industry
particularly highlighting 2016's top box office hits as points of observation to show how Hollywood has a bunch of work to
do on the representation front. But enough overview, let's get into how to use our website.

Head on over to https://squaaa.github.io/TheBechdelTest/. The squaaa is pronounced $quaaa, as if you are in a music
video and you gotta let your Day 1s know that it's their turn to jump in. Upon arrival you'll be greeted with a
beautiful landing page, giving you a view of Hollywood right over city limits. To be honest that's just a guess; Jess
did all the landing page work so I pretty much made everything up in the second half of that sentence. Anyway, after you
hit Enter, wait for the countdown (because we had to be extra) and you'll be presented with our cinematic masterpiece
(our intro page).


The intro page will provide some information about the Bechdel test, and ask you a question. It currently asks how many
of the top 10 movies of 2016 passed the Bechdel test, but that might change depending on how many new ideas come in and
our willingness to provide the fun most engaging interface this side of the Ol' Mississippi, first place obviously goes
to the Google team in California where they invented the running dinosaur game when your internet is out. After
answering whatever question you'll be shown some bars showing more info about the top 10 movies with info about its
title, box office, Bechdel evaluation and video clip. You'll also be able to load more details for info about cast and
crew, with a bit of data analysis.

The next part of the website transitions into Bechdel results over time. We'll ask you when the first time over half of
the movies made past the Bechdel test. Let me tell you right now sonny, the results ain't pretty, but our visualizations
sure are. Explore the results over a variety of parameters presented in the drop down menu, and highlight a portion of
the area chart to observe more details in the bar chart below it. I know, so much interactivity, we're really spoiling
yall down there. There's so much detail in this section, but I can't go over it all cuz that Lucy's schtik, but boy if
it aint the most purtiest and technologically comprehensive viz you've seen...

Anyways, the last section is basically the conclusion. I'm running out of jokes but it's self explanatory. Thanks for
visiting and remember to always remember to do your part in shaping inclusivity and representation.
