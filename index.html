    <h1>The Bechdel Test: Representation of Women in Film</h1>

            <h2>What is the Bechdel Test?</h2>
            <div id="intro">
                <p>The Bechdel Test (also known as the Bechdel Rule or Mo Movie Measure) is a simple assessment used to indicate the active presence of women in Hollywood films and measure their dynamic character profile.
                    It was originally coined by Allison Bechdel in the comic strip <i>Dykes to Watch Out For</i> in 1985.
                    Through three rules, it forms a relatively simple baseline for female representation in film:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There must be at least two women, </li>
                    <li>Who talk to each other,</li>
                    <li>About something other than a man.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Easy enough, right?</p>

                <p>DATA ANALYSIS (In Progress)</p>
                <p>Although the majority of the top 10 movies of 2018 passed the Bechdel Test, only a few them passed
                    the test with more then a few lines of dialogue. In multiple ways these movies failed on the
                    representation front. There amount of female directors is 0, which is equal to the amount of movies
                    with more female producers than male producers. And only two movies have female writers, while a
                    total of zero movies have more female writers than male writers. Even when looking at cast and crew
                    as a whole, the average breakdown is 71% male for cast and 74% for crew. The Bechdel Test is a
                    very small baseline, that most of these movies do pass, but the spirit of idea equal representation
                    is clearly missed.</p>

                    <p class="number proportion">The proportion of movies that pass the Bechdel test seems to be
                        growing very slowly over time, with about half of movies passing the test in recent years.</p>
                    <p class="genre-info">There are large differences between movies of different genres: 80% of
                        musicals have passed the Bechdel test, while at the other end of the spectrum, just 25%
                        of documentaries have passed the test.</p>
                    <p>There also appears to be a difference between the economic success of movies that pass the test
                        and movies that fail it.</p>
                    <p class="budget gross">In 2013, the most recent year for which we have data, movies that passed
                        the Bechdel test made up 36% of the total budget but 48% of the total domestic gross.</p>
                    <p>While we can't say this effect is causal, movies that pass the Bechdel test seem to be generating
                        more money domestically relative to the size of their budgets.</p>

        <h2>So What? (I'm Still A Rockstar)</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>From our website it's clear to see that there's still a lot that needs to be done in terms of female
                    representation in film. Although we're clearly making process, it's important to recognize that
                    our current level of representation is still lacking.</p>
                <p>The Bechdel Test is an incredibly trivial baseline for a movie to meet. One non-male centered
                    conversation between two female characters isn't a difficult task. And accomplishing this doesn't even
                    guarantee that the film (with its cast, crew, and content) promotes gender equality.</p>
                <p>Still, the Bechdel Test serves as an intuitive evaluation for whether a film ignores the importance of
                    diverse representation in media. It's our duty to push for diversity and representation not just out of
                    moral obligation, but to instill values of equality in media consumers of all generations.</p>
