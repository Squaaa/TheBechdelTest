Yo yo yo it's ya boi JSoy. And congrats on making it to the coolest website CS171 has ever seen. Head on over to
https://squaaa.github.io/TheBechdelTest/. The squaaa is pronounced $quaaa, as if you are in a music video and you gotta
let your Day 1s know that it's their turn to jump in.

Upon arrival you'll be greeted with a beautiful landing page, giving you a view of Hollywood right over city limits. To be honest that's just a guess; Jess
did all the landing page work so I pretty much made everything up in the second half of that sentence. Anyway, after you
hit Enter, wait for the countdown (because Jess had to be extra) and you'll be presented with our cinematic masterpiece
(our intro page).

The intro page will provide some information about the Bechdel test, and ask you a question. It currently asks how many
of the top 10 movies of 2016 passed the Bechdel test, but that might change depending on how many new ideas come in and
our willingness to provide the fun most engaging interface this side of the Ol' Mississippi, first place obviously goes
to the Google team in California where they invented the running dinosaur game when your internet is out. After
answering whatever question you'll be shown some bars showing more info about the top 10 movies with info about its
title, box office, Bechdel evaluation and video clip. You'll also be able to load more details for info about cast and
crew, with a bit of data analysis. Yall see that innovative bubble chart right there. Poppin ain't it, ya gurl Cassandra
was all over that schtick. Call some Scots over because she kilt it.

The next part of the website transitions into Bechdel results over time. We'll ask you when the first time over half of
the movies made past the Bechdel test. Let me tell you right now sonny, the results ain't pretty, but our visualizations
sure are. Explore the results over a variety of parameters presented in the drop down menu, and highlight a portion of
the area chart to observe more details in the bar chart below it. I know, so much interactivity, we're really spoiling
yall down there. There's so much detail in this section, but I can't go over it all cuz that Lucy's schtik, but boy if
it aint the most purtiest and technologically comprehensive viz you've seen...

Anyways, the last section is basically the conclusion. Read it to learn more in-depth analysis, or not (I'm not a cop).
Idk, I have hoemwork and I'm running out of jokes... the section is pretty self explanatory. Thanks for
visiting and remember to always do your part in shaping inclusivity and representation.
